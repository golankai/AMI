English model and business owner, has her own clothing and perfume line if I remember correctly. Blond, philanthropist, works with Calvin Klien a lot - pops up in a lot of adverts, if you don't know her name you've definitely seen her face. Has acted in some things, collaborated with musicians and appeared in a lot of music videos. Philanthropist. Tall. Part of the 'chic' movement of the late 90s? Pretty. Fashionable, probably has a stockpile of perfume somewhere. Appartently started modelling again recently after stopping for a while? Slim. Wealthy, Probably one of the most famous British models around - one of those sorts of people.
