Kate is relatively tall. She has dark-hair, which is shoulder-length. She is pretty, thin, and a mother to three children. She is married to Prince William. She comes across as well-mannered, polite, and has a nice smile. She would be a nice person to meet. She seems to be enthusiastic about sports, is patron of a tennis association, and fits in well as a royal, towing the ""party line"" and coming across as a strong ambassador for the royal family, if lacking a little in personality. She also engages a lot with charities, particularly those focusing on mental health and children, and just seems to be an all-round good egg.
