Daniel Radcliffe seems smaller on Tv but I think he is taller than you would expect. I have been able to see him on tv from the age of 11 and you can see him changing from a very young boy of 11 to a man. He was skinny and very geeky but he has developed into a recognisable figure. I have never met him in person but when on tv he was very charming and friendly. I think he comes across as humble and graceful and a funny person. He seems to interact well with others. He is clearer a talents actor with lots of experience.
