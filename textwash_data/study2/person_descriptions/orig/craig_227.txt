Daniel Craig is an actor well known, obviously, for his role in James Bond, who he plays fantastically. He is a British actor, known by all the nation as James Bond himself, having played the roll for many many years now. Although, not a big fan myself, I understand he is enjoyed by many of all ages. He has been acting in other things but as he's been portrayed as james bond for such a long while now, everyone accosiates him with that, like he's a real life james bond. His films are usually action films, as that genre belongs to him a lot, as he's good at fighting and being that hero character in everything he;s in.
