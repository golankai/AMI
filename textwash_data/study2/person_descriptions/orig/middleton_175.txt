Married to Prince William and so is the Duchess of Cambridge, studied with him at St Andrews University in Scotland. She has 3(??) children and during one of her pregnancies did an amount of raising awareness for the negative symptoms of pregnancy (morning sickness etc) as she was apparently quite ill. She was photographed topless by the French paparazzi while sunbathing on a private property - the photographs where published by a Danish gossip magazine, and the female editor defended this decision with a lot of sexist comments. She's involved in work with various charities (e.g. Sports Aid) she's usually at Wimbledon every year (i think).
