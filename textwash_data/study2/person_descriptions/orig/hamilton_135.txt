Lewis Hamilton is best known for being a top formula one racing car driver.
Lewis Hamilton started driving when he was a young child. He was the youngest driver, winning the race at the age if 11 years old. He continued to win many races and gain numerous trophies along the way. He has maninly worked for ferrari although my personal opinion is that many other big names would like to offer him a high rate although i think he is quite dedicated to them.
Lewis Hamiltons has a disabled brother who attends the majority of his races.
