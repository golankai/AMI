Kate Moss is a tall, fashionable, blond woman with a rather strange face. Her eyes look like they had a fight and have decided to stay as far away as possible from one another and her nose sort of looks like it's made from playdough. She is very skinny in a lot of pictures like she works at being skinny too hard and has forgotten what bodies are supposed to look like. If aliens abducted her as an example of our species the would conclude we aren't that different after all. She has a wavy hairstyle and looks unimpressed a lot of the time. I guess because that's what the camera wants. Her eyebrows are really thin too
