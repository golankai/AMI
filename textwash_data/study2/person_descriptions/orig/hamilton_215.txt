Lewis Hamilton is a British racing driver, who has won a number of races for the British team as well as joining the McLaren F1 team in 2007 till 2012, he then transferred/joined the Mercedes team till present, from what i have heard he is making a lot of money doing what he does, one deal he made was apparently worth Â£100million, i don't know any other drivers that can get that same amount of money for a team contract, he also puts a lot of practice into his runs and training, i suppose it isn't easy being in the top of your sport.
