He is an English actor. He is clever and trustworthy. His best film series is Harry Potter. He is the best friend of every kid that has watched harry potter. He has an illness called dyspraxia.He is good a t singing once he sang with all of the letter in alphabet. He is short and wearing glasses. He played mostly in solo movies.His acting is one of the best ones. Yellow is his favorite color. He looks genuine and generous. I like watching his movies as he plays every role as he that role.  I think he might be one of the richest Harry Potter actor.
