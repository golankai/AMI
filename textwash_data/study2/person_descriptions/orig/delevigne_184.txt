Cara Delevingne is a model turned actress and singer. She became a model at quite a young age and her rise to fame continued from there. Cara was born in Hammersmith in London and went to an all-girls school until she dropped out and pursued a professional career in modelling, like her sister before her. She has walked at some of the largest events of the fashion world such as the New York, London, Milan, and international fashion weeks. 
Later came her breakthrough into acting when she played Princess Sorokina in Anna Karenina but she is arguably better known for her roles in Paper Towns and, most famously in Suicide Squad where she played badass Harley Quinn.
