Cara Delevingne is a British model and actress who is best recognised by her full thick eyebrows. She started as a model, and over the years has climbed the ranks working with many high profile fashion houses such as Burberry, Chanel and Fendi, and has walked catwalks several times at all of the 'Big Four' fashion shows across the world. She has also collaborated with Mulberry and DKNY to release her own fashion collections. For the last few years, she has appeared in less catwalks and fashion shows as she has been focusing on her acting career, starring in TV shows such as Carnival Row and films such as Suicide Squad. Cara has also in recent years identified as bisexual and gender fluid.
