J K Rowling is a white, middle aged female with long blonde hair who was born in the UK.

She is an author, most well-known for the incredibly successful Harry Potter series, which made her the first billionaire author, a label she rejects as untrue, due to having given much of her wealth to charity.

She has also worked on movies as a producer, and writer. She is also well-known for her philanthropy but has been involved in some controversy due to expressing her views on certain social issues on social media sites regarding Trans issues.

It is quite well known that whilst writing the Harry Potter series, she struggled financially. Since becoming wealthy however, she has not forgotten the help she received and is vociferous about pay due taxes in an honest manner and the positive aspects of the social safety net the state provides.
