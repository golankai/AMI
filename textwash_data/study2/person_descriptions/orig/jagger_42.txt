Mick Jagger is the lead singer of the English Rock Band ""The Rolling Stones"". He must be pretty old by now, probably around 80. We saw Mick Jagger and ""The Rolling Stones"" perform last in 2018 in the Olympic Stadium in London. He was super fit, running around on his slim legs. If you see his skin, you think that this guy has enjoyed life, probably with a lot of sex and drugs, too. Well, Mich Jagger certainly has a long list of partners and spouses...
Wikipedia suggests that Mick Jagger apparently went to the London School of Economics and Political Science. I wonder, if he could be called one of the most successful British singers.
