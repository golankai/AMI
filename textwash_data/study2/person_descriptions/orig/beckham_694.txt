David Beckham is the ultimate, world wide phenomenon that oozes sex appeal and the ‘wow factor’. David Beckham is peacemaker by nature. Because he intuitively knows what people want, or feel, he can be extremely diplomatic and tactful. Patient and cooperative that he is, David works well with groups and somehow finds a way of creating harmony among diverse opinions. David Beckham has the soul of an artist. He is extremely sensitive, perceptive, and a bit shy. These qualities are both his strengths and weaknesses, for while Beckham possesses enormous sensitivity to his feelings and those of others, that same sensitivity can cause him to hold back and repress his considerable talents. Sensitivity and perceptiveness are among Beckham's many fine qualities.
