Cant believe he's still alive. Given his life style in his younger years, I'm surprised he is still around.

Massively influential not only in rock, but probably across many musical genre's.
Ironic British 60s rock band. Paved the way for bands countless rock bands across the world. 

Still performing, which is amazing. 100% woul love to see the Stones perform. I feel like it would be an honour to see with an iconic band play.

Played at the Whitehouse for Obama.

Has a lot of children from multiple relationships.
