Started as a homeless busker in America.
Really quite inspirational in regards to where he started and where he is now musically.
Possibly inspirational to aspiring artists struggling to break into the music business.

Has won multiple awards for his music, and one of the world's most recognised British musicians.

I read that he was invited to Elton Johns party, & took him mum as his plus 1.
Very close to family & wrote a song for her after she passed away.
Married his school sweetheart & has just had a baby together. 
I see him very much as a down to earth family man.

I feel like he wouldn't turn down a request for an autograph
