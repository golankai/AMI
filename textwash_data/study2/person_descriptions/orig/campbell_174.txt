British model and activist, she is probably one of the most famous models ever. She was strongly involved in fundraising for the Mandella foundation, as well as lots of work fighting poverty in Brazil. She has also been accused several times of assault and was called to give evidence in regards to a potential 'Blood Diamond' she was given at an event. She got in quite a lot of trouble for claiming she didn't know who had given her the diamond (something contradicted by other statements) and initially refusing to appear and give evidence.
