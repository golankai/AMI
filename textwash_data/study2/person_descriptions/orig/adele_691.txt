Adele tends to be self-confident, powerful, and assertive. Adele generally enjoys engaging in debates and making difficult decisions. She has a romantic personality, but her love is more impersonal as she tends to be focused on her dreams instead. When not in harmony with her true nature, Adele can fall to moodiness, or become aloof, and withdrawn. She can also become timid, uncertain, and ungrateful, putting the blame for her troubles on others or the world. She is often disappointed by the realities of life, her own shortcomings, and those of others, and is relentlessly driven to improve upon it all - striving for greater accomplishments. This is Adele's life-lesson - to accept the natural limitations of the world and its habitants in order to make it possible for her to enjoy life more fully.
