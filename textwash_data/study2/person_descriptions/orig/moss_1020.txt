Kate Moss seems to be beyond the peak of her career right now, with such intense features. She has the kind of eyes that if you look into for too long you won't be able to stand it. With such golden blonde hair, her hair looks like it was seeped in melted gold and casted on her head. She also has eyes like she has got some asian blood in her lineage. She has explored every nook and cranny of the modeling career, definitely a hall of fame material. She looks like she can still get into a couple of other things, like movies for exam. She even looks like an actress. She would be the badass old timer in those movies, those ladies that are still very much involved but they are at the boss levels.
