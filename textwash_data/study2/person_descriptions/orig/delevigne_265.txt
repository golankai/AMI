Cara is a striking blonde model from England.  She has blonde hair and large eyebrows which are probably her most distinguishing feature.  Her sister is also quite famous but I can't remember what for.
Cara is also an actress, she has a lot of tattoos, she is gay or bisexual, she has had battles with her mental health in the past.
She comes from a wealthy background and grew up in an exclusive area, and is someone I would consider very ""posh"".
She tends to wear rather androgenous clothing -when I picture her it would be wearing a trouser suit, probably black.
