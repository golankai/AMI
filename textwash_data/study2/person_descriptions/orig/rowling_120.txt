ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS OF ALL TIME! She is hugely popular and best known for her Harry Potter series, which shows the fun side of mystery and magic but also a darker side to keep the older kids engaged. She did not become successful until later in her life but is now a millionaire with a huge fan base. She has won a number of awards and her name is known all around the world. Hugely talented and very pretty lady that will be known for many many years to come! She has 3 children who I am certain are huge fans of her series and love how well known their mum is.
