Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, became a member of the British Royal Family via marriage to Prince William, in which she has had three children, and thus three heirs to throne, with. She holds a degree in History of Art from the University of St Andrews, where she consequently met Prince William. Kate Middleton is said to have great influence in fashion in Europe as well as the Americas, with what may be described as a modest, and perhaps 'Sloanie' typed style. As consistent with her Royal role, Kate has taken up  patronage within over 20 charitable and military organisations, including Action for Children, SportsAid, and the National Portrait Gallery.
