Adele is a British singer and song writer who has won a number of Emmys and other music awards. Earlier on in her career, she stood out from other popular singers due to her appearance, which did not fit in with the beauty standard for that role - thin, athletic, conventionally attractive. She rose to prominence due to her incredible voice, ranging several octaves; but also due to the qualities of her writing. She often writes about painful events, notably breakups, and the sadness they result in. Her tone is honest and captivating, producing a strong emotion in the listener.
