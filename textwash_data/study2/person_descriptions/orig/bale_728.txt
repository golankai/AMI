Born in Pembrokeshire, Wales on the 30th January 1974 to English parents, Christian Bale is an award-winning British actor.

He is perhaps best known for his performances as the brooding superhero, Batman, between 2005 and 2012 in Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises; one of the highest-grossing trilogies of all time. 

Despite his first-ever acting role being in a commercial for Lenor fabric softener when he was just eight years old, remarkably Bale has never received any formal training in acting.
