David Beckham has a roughly triangular head that seems to have been flattened at some point while playing football. It seems like in an attempt to hide this he has applied too much hair gel and made his har all tall and wavy. Other than that he is quite stern looking with a large mustache and a wel trimmed beard. He has many tattoos on his arms, hands and chest which look pretty mediocre for someone with so much money. He looks a lot less stupid than he sounds. His eyes look brown and they are quite sunken in giving the impression of very dark eyes, this is intimidating. Overall he looks quite generic for a posh footballer
