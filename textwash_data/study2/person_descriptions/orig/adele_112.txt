Adele is a singer from England, she's in her late 20s and has had a lot of commercial success with her music with hits such as Hello, Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You etc.  I don't think she's released much in the last couple of years though.  She was married but is divorced now and has one child.  She has been in the news a good bit recently as she lost a lot of weight, she was always a bit plump but now is very slim.  No matter what weight she was, she was always very beautiful and has an amazing voice.
