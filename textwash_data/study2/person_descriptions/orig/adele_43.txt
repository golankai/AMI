Adele is an English Singer born in London. Adele is best know for her incredible voice, but also for not performing too much. I think I would probably describe her genre as somewhere between soul and pob. Adele is probably best know for her moving balads.
 
At first I was not sure if Adele was still active as a singer, and apparently there is a new album coming out. When I looked up Adele, I learned that she had earned  fifteen Grammy Awards, and nine Brit Awards. Apparently, Adele recently divorced her husband and they have a child.
