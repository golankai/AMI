DAME JUDI DENCH IS AN ICON. Actress - I think has also done some theatre. Makes even the most mediorce movie imaginable more entertaining by virtue of being Judi Dench and having a powerful aura. Been in many James Bond movies as M. A staple of British Cinema. Has been Queen Victoria. Often has short hair. Has a really nice voice. Has been acting for a few decades is generally the best part of anything she's in. Has a wide range, historical drama to comedy. Nice little old lady. Love her. Deserving of being a dame.
