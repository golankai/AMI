Kate Moss is a staple and figurehead of fashion, especially British fashion. She is one of the most well known supermodels of our time, and I personally see her as the most glamorous representation of what you'd expect a groupie in the 70s to look like. She's punk, she's carefree, she's the mother of punk looks. She is very beautiful, although personally not my type, and she seems to be the kind of person who would really care about environmentally conscious fashion. She's one of the biggest names in her industry, which is a really difficult industry to get into. I bought some of her make up once when I was a teenager and wore it obsessively, thinking it would make me like her, because who doesn't want to be like the Mick Jagger of modelling? I think it was a Maybelline line, and it was a dark red and they sold it as a Kate Moss staple, because only someone as cool as her could wear something like that. She seems like she really puts a lot of thought into the products she endorses, and I feel like I could really trust her opinion about clothing and make up: I feel like she would be really attentive, trying to find the best outfits for the best photos, and won't stop shooting until she believes she has the perfect shot
