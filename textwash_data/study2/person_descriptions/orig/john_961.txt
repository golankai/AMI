Elton John is a British singer/song writer who rose to prominence in the 1970s. He is an iconic musician of his generation, with his talent universally and globally recognised both by fans and multiple music awards. He is famously homosexual and has been an activist for the destigmatisation of homosexuality over the last decades. He has also famously struggled with addiction and depression, and has attempted to ""come clean"" with stints in rehab. He almost always returned to substance abuse, however.
