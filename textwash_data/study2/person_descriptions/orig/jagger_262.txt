Mick Jagger is in his 70s but acts like he is much younger.  He also appears younger.  He has a large mouth, long hair and very electric on-stage presence.  He's a talented singer and songwriter and very attractive!  I always found him very attractive, even as a teenager.  These days his face is marked with wrinkles but he is still very much identifiable as the famous face that he is.  On stage he prances around, makes big gestures and opens his large mouth even wider.  He tends to wear jackets, I imagine him wearing a velvet jacket with a wide collar, but perhaps that is because of stereotypically 70s style collars from photos of him from his youth with the Rolling Stones.
