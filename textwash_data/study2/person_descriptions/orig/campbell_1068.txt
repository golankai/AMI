Naomi Campbell is known for being the very first black woman to be on a cover of Vogue France. I only know her for being a top model, walking the runway of high profile fashion brands like Ralph Lauren and Versace

I do not really know much about her, but I think she was also involved with drugs (which I think is very common with being famous). No judgment there. But it looks like it was just a phase, and she turned out to be the best she can be (what a cliche line).

Now a mother of a cute girl, she serves to be an influence in the fashion industry.
