that ginger singer. wrote a song with beyonce. wrote instrumentals and a few lyrics for BTS. seems like a clout chaser and populist musician based on his collaboration choices, but i dont really care. the name i say when i see any other ginger person or animal. literally saw a ginger cat the other day and called it ed sheeran, i don't care about morals or ethics. the one guy who releases any kind of song and the radios are obsessed even though they are so generic it makes me want to kill myself.  the one ho has viral clips from the show with that one guy who has an amusing laugh.
