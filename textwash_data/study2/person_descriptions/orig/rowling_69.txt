Sam Smith is a singer. They are best known for works like ""Stay with me"", ""Money on my Mind"" and ""La La La"". This music rose to critical acclaim in countries such as the UK and the US, and was heard on popular radio stations often. Their music was always quite soul-wrenching, a lot of personal distress has been portrayed into their music. They are recognised as quite a strong force within the LGBT community, after coming out as gay, in 2014. This influence was felt through the music put out, as people were able to relate it to their public relationships at the time. A few years back, Sam Smith came out as genderqueer - meaning that they do not personally align with any gender, preferring the pronouns they/them. This caused a stink with the media, who were continuing to use incorrect pronouns, causing offence to not just themselves, but thousands of people who are still coming to terms with their identity. Sam Smith stood strong amid this gender erasure, and has become an icon for those with similar backgrounds.
