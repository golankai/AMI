He was sherlock in the series which i thought was really good. he was also in star trek and lord of the rings so hes been really busy. hes been on a bunch of talk shows like graham norton and was in theatre for a bit too. my favourite fim of his was doctor strange which i thought was casted really well and he did the character justice. he plays a smart smug character really well and i think hes generally considered good looking to women. hes tall dark and handsome and has a strong accent so it makes sense
