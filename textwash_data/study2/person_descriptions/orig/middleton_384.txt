Kate Middleton, even though not from the Royal roots, seemed to have that instinct to immediately transform herself into a true classy lady. She has an excellent sense of style, which really emphasises elegance, etiquette, convention, discretion, and tradition. She is an educator, she is charitable and she is so damn beautiful. Her love for Prince William shines through and they seem to have a wonderful family. The fact I love most about her, is that she does all the grocery shopping and she cooks for the family! Imagine being a duchess, and cooking for yourself. That really speaks volumes about her personality and what a deep individual she really is.
