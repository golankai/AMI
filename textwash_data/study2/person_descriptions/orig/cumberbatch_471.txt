I do not know this actor very well but he looks extremely tall. He has blonde hair and a fair complexion. He is very slim and slender. His skin is a bit rough around the cheeks. I have not seen him on tv often but I have watched him on a few chat shows. He is very composed and well spoken. He comes across as from a very privileged background from his mannerism and how he presents himself. He seems to be well educated. He is not the most famous person I know and I do not think a lot of people would know him or be able to give an example of something he has been in.
