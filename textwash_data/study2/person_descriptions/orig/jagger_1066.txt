Without looking Mick Jagger up at google, I would assume that he is a famous singer and actor. Why I said that? I saw a recent Harry Styles SNL appearance, wherein Harry impersonated him: shaggy hair, very loud but superb fashion choice, and funny voice. 

I also know Mick Jagger as the lead singer of Rolling Stones. And that's about it. I used to have a t-shirt with the band logo in front, although I do not really know much about the band. You must say I am pretentious wanna-be fan. But no, I just like the fit of the shirt, you judgmental hater. And if you ask me what Rolling Stones  song is my favourite? I don't have one. Sorry not sorry.
