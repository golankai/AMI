Daniel Radcliffe is a white man in his early thirties with short brown hair, and sometime sports a scruffy beard. Daniel was born in the UK

Daniel is an actor who rose to prominence at a young age having been cast as the title character in the Harry Potter films. Since then he has been cast in further films, but none have been as successful, although this would admittedly be very difficult as the Harry Potter series was one of the most successful box office film franchises ever. This work has left Daniel in an incredibly stable financial position.

Daniel is also known for his love of rap music and support for the LGBTQ community. Daniel appears to have left leaning political tenancies.
