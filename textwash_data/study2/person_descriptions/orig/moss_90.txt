Kate Moss, who was born in Croydon in 1974, rose to fame in the 1990s as a supermodel. She gained most fame for her modelling with Calvin Klein, and specifically for her role in the 'heroin chic' trend which gained widespread condemnation for promoting drug taking and unhealthy lifestyles (she was often labelled as 'anorexic'). 

In 2005 she was involved in a drug scandal that resulted in her losing high value contracts with H&M, Chanel and Burberry. Although she never admitted her drug taking she did apologise.

Kate Moss has previously been romantically involved with Pete Doherty of The Libertines and was once married to Jamie Hince from band, The Kills.

She received negative coverage from PETA for wearing fur many times during her career
