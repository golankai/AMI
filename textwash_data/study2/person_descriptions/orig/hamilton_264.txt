Lewis Hamilton is an attractive racing driver, he appears tall and often has facial hair, he sometimes wears his hair in braids, he is of mixed ethnicity and identifies as Black.  When I picture him, I imagine him wearing his racing driving suit and holding his helmet, or a cup he has just won.  I didn't know much about Lewis Hamilton before now, I have just read about him and am impressed with his career, how much wealth he has accumulated, and how he has been active in animal rights.  HE even has his own vegan burger restaurant, which I am now keen to try.
