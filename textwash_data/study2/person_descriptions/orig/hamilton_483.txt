Lewis Hamilton is a formula 1 driver. I dont know much about him but I did see the top gear episode he was on years ago and he did a really fast lap and was pretty funny and friendly. hes won loads of races but I dont know much about formula one so i cant go into detail about that. I do know hes very respected in his field and is one of the best in the world at what he does. He has done some sponsored work and ads too like im pretty sure he has merchandise like tshirts etc that you can buy. He is a good looking man probably in his thirties and Im not sure if hes married or has children but hes very successful.
