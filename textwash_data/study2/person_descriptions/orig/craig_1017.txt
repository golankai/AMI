Daniel Craig, the actor of one of the most epic movie franchise of all time. He is short but definitely looks like somebody you wouldn't want to mess with because he is very much capable of kicking your ass. He has intense eyes, with great physique. I wonder how he manages to maintain that look after all these year, he never seems to be getting older. Looks like he can still go a couple rounds in the movie franchise and I want to see him act other movies, I don't think I have ever seen that before.
