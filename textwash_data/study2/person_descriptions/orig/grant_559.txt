British actor. Typical British gentleman with his queen's English, London accent.

However  was famously found in a car with a sex worker. 

I see him as an actor who mainly does rom-coms. Which I'm not a fan of. I must have seen a small handful of his films. 

I dont actually know a right lot about him. He doesnt seem to be in the press a lot, so I imagine he prefers to stay out of the limelight.
I didnt even know he was married & has several children.

Was in a relationship with Elizabeth Hurley at one point.
