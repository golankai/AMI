Adele is a female single from Tottenham, London. She went to the Brit school as a teenager and won her first Brit award at the 2006 awards for the critics choice award for her album 19. Since then she has won 86 awards including Grammys, Brits etc and had 150 more nominations. Adele has written and performed the soundtrack for the James Bond theme “Skyfall”. She has one son called Angelo. She lives in California. Although she used to live in Brighton down the road from me! Adele has got a lot of attention in the media for her dramatic weight loss in the last couple of years. She went through a divorce and found exercise and green juice and restricts her calories. Good for her - she looks insane :)
