Probably represents some of the best contemporary British music at the moment. Although she seems to only sing about broken past relationships. Gets a bit repetitive after a while. How many times can you write an album about the same relationship.

Wrote a song for a bond film.

Has lost an incredible amount of weight, and now looks unrecognisable. She looks stunning.

I feel like Adele would be an amazing person to go for a drink with as she just seems incredibly down to earth and genuine.

Has achieved an amazing amount for her young age, & now lives in America with her family.
