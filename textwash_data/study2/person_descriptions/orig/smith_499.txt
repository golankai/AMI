Oh won't you SSSSSTTTTAaAYyyyyyy with me, Sam Smith, 29 and genderqueer. They're another popular artist with many a tune under their belt. Sam may be a relative youngster but they've smashed the UK Music scene by storm.  Selling over 30 millon albums worldwode.  
Sam has grammys, Brits and other musical awards - enough to have a significant trophies cabinet his nan would be proud of. 

Like Adele, sam has also performed a James Bond theme with the Writings on the wall. This was in 2015 and it won a golden globe. Ta dah another one for the list of bling.
