Kate Moss is a supermodel, she is tall and slim and was discovered in a London train station when she was in her early teens. She has been the face of a number of beauty products over the years. However, she faced public embarrassment and was fired from being the face of these products when she was caught taking cocaine and linked with heroin addict boyfriend Pete Doherty. Kate Moss entered rehab and later became the face of Topshop, releasing her own fashion ranges. She has been declared as Britains wealthiest supermodel, although the rock and roll party lifestyle of her past seems to have taken its toll on her hair and skin.
