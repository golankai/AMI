Adele is a woman of high status. And I am not talking about her behavior or some kind of social status or her ancestry! No, no, no.I can describe her that she radiates this high status with her behavior. The behavior of a noble person. She knows that she is a great and amazing female singer. Furthermore, she is a real woman. A woman full of sexuality and lust and I am sure that she knows how to use these gifts to be number one with men and boys. She is attractive and she knows this also. Her energy is beautiful, her body, her voice.
