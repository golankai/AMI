Born on July 19th, 1976, Benedict Cumberbatch is a multi-award-winning British actor whose varied career includes roles on stage, screen, and radio.

His penchant for acting is no surprise when considering that his parents, Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton are both actors themselves.

Although he played Stephen Hawking in a 2004 television movie, Cumberbatch became a household name playing the titular role in the 2010 BBC adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. 

He married theatre director, Sophie Hunter, in 2015, and together they have three sons.
