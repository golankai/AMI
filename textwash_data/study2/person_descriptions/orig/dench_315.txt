Judi dench â€“ the first thing that comes to my mind is the cat leader in the recent CATS film! I think she is a very classy and classical actor. She seems very kind and hard working especially considering her age and on going success. 

She has played many big parts in her acting career and makes me think of a kind, nana figure. She seems steady, happy and soft. 
She as won many awards over her career and I admire the amount of work that has gone into that especially many years ago when a lady actor would have been less respected and it must have been hard
