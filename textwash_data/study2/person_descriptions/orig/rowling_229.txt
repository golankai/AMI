J.K rowling is the author and creator of Harry Potter. She is a British woman and has gained an immense success from her books which are now all adapted into films, from the early 2000s and still continuing. She was born in England and has a huge following. She has been under fire recently for being transphobic towards trans women which has subsequently lost her a lot of following right now, a lot of people do not like her and rightly so, she is outwardly transphobic and never apologies fore what she says because she belives it is right which has put a lot of people like me off of her.
