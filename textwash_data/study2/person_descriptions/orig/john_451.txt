Elton John is a British singer songwriter, who has been a household name in the UK (and indeed, the wider world) since the 1970s.  Some of his greatest hits include ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", ""Benny and The Jets"" and ""Passengers"".  His touching tribute to Princess Diana was the multi-million selling single ""Candle in the Wind"", which he performed a special version of at her funeral, changing the lyrics from the original song which had been a tribute to Marilyn Monroe.  His duet with Kiki Dee was ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" which was one of Elton's many number one UK singles.  He famously wore oversized spectacles, and was an early public figure who obviously had a hair transplant.
