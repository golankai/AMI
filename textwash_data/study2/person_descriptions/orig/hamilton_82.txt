Born in Stevenage, England in 1985, Lewis Hamilton is one of the most prominent Formula One drivers in the world. 

Hamilton has always been interested in race car driving, from a young age he joined the McLaren young driver programme. In 2007, Hamilton continued his journey with McLaren and became the first and only Black driver to race in Formula One drive. Hamilton has won seven World Drivers' Championship titles, a record he shares with Michael Schumacher. As of recently, he holds the record for most wins (100), podium finishes (176) and pole positions (101).

Despite these incredible accolades, Hamilton has been centre of attention with the press for multiple reasons, from girls, to toxic masculinity to racism. Hamilton held the title of a ""ladies man"" as he would be seen with multiple women, many who have claimed less than charming behaviour from the F1 driver. Hamilton was also accused of toxic masculinity when he teased his nephew for wearing a dress. However, in the last year Lewis Hamilton's public image has turned around as he has spoken up about racism in the sporting industry. An insight so many people have valued especially with him being the first and only Black driver to race in Formula One.
