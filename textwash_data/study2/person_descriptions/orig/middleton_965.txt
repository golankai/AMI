Kate Middleton has a privileged upbringing, having grown up in an upper middle class family and been educated at a public school (Marlborough College). Nevertheless, her marriage to Prince William was inexplicably covered by the media as if she was a much lower class person marrying into the Royal Family and almost being gifted a princess lifestyle that would have otherwise been completely unattainable. Their relationship was widely perceived to be fairytale-style, with even royal sceptics captured by the ""magic"" of the royal wedding. She is still seen as the ""perfect""/archetypal princess and female role model by the British press, especially in recent comparisons with Meghan Markle, who is reluctant to fit with the rules and standards of the Royal Family.
