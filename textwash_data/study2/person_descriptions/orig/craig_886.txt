Daniel Craig is 007! Although regularly in work, he was not a household name until he took over the role of James Bond from Pierce Brosnan in 2006 in the film Casino Royale. Since then he has appeared in Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre and the latest, and his last as 007, No Time To Die. He also participated in the amazing stunt for the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony, in which he accompanied the queen, in his role as one of her Secret Agents, as she abseiled from a helicopter down into the Stadium. Is there life after Bond for Daniel Craig? Well, he has just finished work on Knives Out 2 and has more tv and films in the pipeline, so the future looks rosy for him as he retires from Her Majestyâ€™s Secret Service.
