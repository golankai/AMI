Ah the beautiful and talented Adele. A voice from heaven (if a woman scorned could fly down and sing like Adele that would be a turn up for the books). Adele born in 1988 (a year younger than me, *sobs*) has been awarded an MBE for her services to popular music.  Adele has so many accolades to her name, I bet in her house she has a huge wall of trophies. I bet her mam is well proud. She seems like a top lass who knows how to have fun. She's been criticised and praised over her body image and personally I think she's always looked awesome. So many of her songs will have you singing all-night- Rolling in the deeeeeeeeeeeppppp.
