Daniel Radcliffe is best known for his role in Harry Potter. He started this when he was so young (just 10 years old) and made numerous movies. He is well know everywhere. He is short with brown hair and glasses and I’ve never come across anyone who does know who he is or hasn’t heard of Harry Potter. He also did a Role in the Woman in Black which was a very popular horror film. He was born and raised in London. He was also in Now you See me (a personal favourite) which is very popular on Netflix.
