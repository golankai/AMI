Ricky Gervais, the classic English comedian and creator of the iconic sitcom ""The Office"" (arguably the one show where the US remake was better than the British one). Gervais is not only the ""face of funny"" in the UK, but can also boast a degree in Philosophy from UCL (and a failed music career...). He has credits as a comedian, singer, actor, director, and producer. He is a vegetarian (he is very vocal on twitter about his support for animal welfare), has no children (specifically because there are too many), and has been with his partner since 1982 (unmarried because whats the point in marriage if there is no god).
