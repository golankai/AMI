Daniel Craig kind of looks like a partially melted wax work of a handsome man. His head is quite a bit smaller than his shoulders would suggest and his sagging eyebrows and receding hair line make it look as though his forehead is dripping like a liquid. His ears look big but in truth are probably just normal sized, this coupled with a pointyish chin, thin lips and piercing eyes give the impression of a goblin like creature. I wouldn't be surprised to find something like this living in a cave. All of this is in stark contrast to his well built body, he has large muscles and looks strong.
