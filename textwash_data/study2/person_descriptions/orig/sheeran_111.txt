Ed Sheeran is a singer songwriter from England.  He has ginger hair and blue eyes, he wouldn't be the best looking man in the world but his music is really popular.  He has had a lot of chart hits, at one stage I think he had three songs in the top five at the same time.  He has a bit of a scruffy, nerdy look and wears jeans and jumpers a lot.  His hair looks a bit dishevelled and scruffy.  He sometimes wears glasses.  He has a kind face and a nice smile and seems to be a nice person.  He is married to his long term girlfriend and wrote a lovely song about her.  He is about to start another tour at the minute.  He also plays the guitar and has collaborated with a lot of other artists.
