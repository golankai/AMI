Ed Sheeran is the boy next door who just so happens to also be famous and the second most-streamed artist of the 2010s. Notoriously private, the Yorkshire-born redhead wed his childhood sweetheart in a private ceremony and then surprised the world in 2020 with the birth of his first child. Sheeran's music style can be described as folk-pop and his album ""รท"" reached 10 singles on the UK charts and the subsequent album tour ended up as the highest-grossing of all time. He also boasts a bestie and music collaborator in Taylor Swift, automatically making him an icon. His arms are adorned with countless tattoos, each possessing a special deeper meaning and he even had a special line of Heinz ketchup named for him ""Edchup.""
