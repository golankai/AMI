A British actor, who rose to significance through his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series. Prior to that he was in a BBC short series production of the book 'Small Island' where he played a relatively insignificant role. Likely now internationally famous for his roles as the dragon in the Hobbit trilogy (I'm not even going to attempt to spell it's name), and as someone in the Marvel films. An interview with him on the Graham Norton show went viral several years back due to his unusual pronunciation of the word 'penguin'. His Alan Rickman impression is pretty great.
