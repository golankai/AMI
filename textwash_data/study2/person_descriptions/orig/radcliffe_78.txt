Famous for the Harry Potter films, but seems to have had a steady career afterwards. Seems to be able to keep his personal life out of the media. I think he has had quite a privileged upbringing which may have helped to get him where he is now. 
He comes across very well in interviews and seems quite down to earth which is good after being famous at quite a young age. Looks to be quite small in height. I understand he had dyspraxia as he had spoken about this in interviews but I wouldn't have know otherwise.
