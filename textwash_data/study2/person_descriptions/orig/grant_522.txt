Huge Grant is a famous British actor. He was born in Hammersmith, West London. He is most well known for his roles in the films of Richard Curtis and his solicitation of an American sex-worker. He once dated Elizabeth Hurley. His look is that of a man-child, post-pubescent public school boy, and whilst he is handsome, he also has something of the 'wet blanket' about him. Speaking from personal experience, he is very charming in real life, although, some of the company he keeps is questionable. He is currently starring in some television series that I believe is based around an illicit affair.
