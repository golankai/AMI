He's an English football legend and a business entrepeneur who is always finding new ways to make his name a brand! He's also had plenty of banter from fellow footballers and fans over his unique hairstyles over the years which is often a comedy topic during late night tv shows. He married Victoria who was one of the members of The Spice Girls and both have remained married and together for well over a decade and are now parents to a few children. David Beckham was always considered to be one of the best corner kickers and penalty shooters as he had an incredible talent on the field for curving his shots which is why ""bend it like Beckham"" became a popular term to use when other players attempted or achieved similar shots themselves.
