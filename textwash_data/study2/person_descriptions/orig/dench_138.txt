Judi Dench is a timeless icon of British culture and silver screen culture. She's in that bracket of incredible older actresses that everyone just LOVES: Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith etc. I feel like Judi is an incredibly funny woman, as you can tell from the various talk shows she's been on, like Graham Norton. You can also tell she has a lot of respect for her profession and has worked hard for all of her life: she must have done, because Hollywood strikes me as the kind of place that would usually cast you out once you got past a certain age. But Judi is incredible, and she's from that passing age of incredible actors who made their debut from Shakespeare. I have SO much respect for her, and the fact that she carried the CATS movie on her back. She's an icon and a true national treasure!
