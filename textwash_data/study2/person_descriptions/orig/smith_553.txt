Sam Smith is white and in his late 20s. He has short brown hair. Many would perhaps call Sam a man, however Sam describes themselves as genderqueer and considers themselves as much a man as a woman. 

Sam smith is a successful singer/songwriter, having won numerous awards and signed lucrative record contracts, although I am not personally familiar with their music. Sam Smith is also well known for their positions on the gender norms in society.

Whilst it is not something I am concerned with personally, there is often a lot of talk in the media about their sexuality.
