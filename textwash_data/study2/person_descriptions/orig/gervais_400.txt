Ricky gervais is an English actor and comedian. He first rose to fame on the UK office - which he wrote and starred in 2001-2003 as David Brent - a typical grumpy cheesy office manager, alongside incredible actors such as Stephen merchant. The office was a mockumentary and it was then copied in the US with a US office version. He went on to produce and star in extras which featured a wealth of celebrities such as Ross Kemp, Les Dennis, Patrick Stewart, Vinnie Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Stiller, Kate Winslet and Francesca Martinez. He went on to product an idiot abroad starring Carl pilkington.
