Joanne ‘J. K.’ Rowling is best known as the international best-selling author of the Harry Potter series of books. She was also active in bringing the books to life as movies with overall approval of the scripts and a production role on some of the later films. As one point a billionaire (she’s since given away a proportion of her fortune to charity), she started out living on benefits. More recently, Rowling has been embroiled in debate around transgender issues, with her views criticised widely by the trans community.
