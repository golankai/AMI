J.K. Rowling had it all: author of the arguably the most beloved and successful fantasy series (sorry LOTR fans), at one point richer than the queen as the first billionaire author, and beloved by her fans. Today she writes subpar novels under the penname Robert Galbraith, endlessly attempts to squeeze money from the franchise that made her famous, and engages in immature and unnecessary twitter battles with former fans. How did it end up like this for the once all-powerful Joanne Rowling? She revealed herself to be a TERF and alienated a large portion of her fanbase, really taking the magic out of many of her devotee's childhoods.
