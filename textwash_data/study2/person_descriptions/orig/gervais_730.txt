Born on 25th June 1961, Ricky Gervais is a writer, actor, and comedian most famous for co-creating, writing, and acting in the popular British sitcom The Office. 

Despite being best-known for his comedy, Gervais actually started his career in the music industry trying to make it as a pop star, as a singer in the 1980s new-wave act 'Seona Dancing'. 

Although popular, Gervais' comedy could occasionally be described as controversial, and he has been very vocal about free speech, and the right of comedians to joke about anything they like. This has invited criticism, even from his peers, with British Comedian James Acaster taking apart Gervais' attitude to joking about transgender people, by ridiculing Gervais' approach in his own set.
