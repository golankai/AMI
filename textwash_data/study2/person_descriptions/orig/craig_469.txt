He is a likeable white male actor who I assume comes from quite a privileged background. The first film that I know him from is layer cake, which is actually a fantastic film based around the criminal activity of the gangs in London dealing in cocaine. Daniel’s character is trying to leave the business and actually doesn’t have a name throughout the whole film. He is most probably best known for portraying James Bond. He took over from Pierce Brosnan and had his debut in the remake of Casino Royale. I think with the new film coming out he will have played James Bond five times. He is married to fellow actress Rachel Weisz.
