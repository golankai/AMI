Naomi, Naomi, Naomi...She's the black panther. The wild, untamed energy, that immediately spellbinds you. She's so elegant, and sophisticated. Truly an iconic individual of the 80's and 90s'. There were entire generations trying to mimic Naomi and her sense of style, so there is literally not much that I can add to that toolbox, but if I was to compare Ms. Campbell to a type of drink, I would say she is the perfect Ch√¢teau Margaux 2009. She's absolutely mesmerising, and has been since the first time I saw her in that Michael Jackson's official video.
