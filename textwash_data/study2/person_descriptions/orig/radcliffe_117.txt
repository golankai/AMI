Daniel Radcliffe born in 1989 would be best recognised as Harry Potter and most would expect him to carry a wand with him wherever he went. He started off on screens as a timid young boy, with very little weight to him but has since emerged with the films to a bearded young man built to fight all kinds of monsters. He has also featured in scary films such as woman in black although that was hard to watch. Born in London with a long term partner, yet to have children. Weirdly he did not attend University which is odd as he appears quite geeky to look at.
