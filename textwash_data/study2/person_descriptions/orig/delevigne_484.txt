Cara Delevigne is mainly known for her modeling work but she also acts. She was in Paper towns which was from a john green book and i hated the film but not because of her. she has amazing bright eyes and thick natural brows which makes her really striking and unique. I had so many friends in college who talked about caras eyebrows and tried to have them themselves. she was also in the suicide squad film which again i didnt rate highly but she was good in it and i loved her character. i dont know anything about her modeling work but i know shes worked with victorias secret.
