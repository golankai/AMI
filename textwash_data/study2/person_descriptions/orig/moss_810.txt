Kate Moss, a world known vegan, is known for her appetite and her ability to create filling vegan dishes full of protein and fats that are sometimes missing from the average vegan's diet. She has inspired many other to become vegans and vegetarians because she has taught many of the public eye to be weary of what they eat and why they eat it, while to others she 's an idol instructing people how to live happy healthy lives at the same time. She was born in a town invested with meat eaters and those who didn't care about what they put in their bodies as long as it tasted good. Even her parents did the same thing. The sort on environment she lived in persuaded her that people don't have to live the way they do, especially if they're unhealthy.
