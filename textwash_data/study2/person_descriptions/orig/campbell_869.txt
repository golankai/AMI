Naomi Campbell is best known as a British catwalk model who has been modelling since she was 15 years old and was quite prolific in the late 1980's and 1990's. One of her brothers is the actor Richard Blackwood, ex Eastenders actor. Naomi is very famous for an epic fall on the catwalk in 1993 when she was wearing a massive pair of Vivienne Westwood nine inch high platforms and a big pink feather boa. Luckily she regained her composure and carried on unharmed aside from a slight dent in her pride. She has just returned to the Catwalk modelling Versace
