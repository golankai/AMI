Kate Middleton the Royal Duchess of Cambridge. She is quite a posh woman married to Prince William. I am not really a royalist so I don’t know too much about her but I believe she has three kids. I remember the first (George maybe???????) being born when I was at my aunties caravan on the isle of sheppey. That describes the difference and contrast between our lives. She does dress nicely too. I think she should show more tributes to princess diana though cos she was amazing and doesn’t get enough credit. I am finding it hard to write 600 plus characters about a member of the royal family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
