Kate Middleton, or the Duchess of Cambridge, is a member of the British Royal family. She married into the Royal Family in 2012 when she married the now Duke of Cambridge, Prince William. Kate Middleton and her husband now have three children: George, Charlotte and Louis. The duchess of Cambridge is second in line to the throne with her husband after Prince Charles so will probably be Queen of England one day. 
The duchess spends most of her working day helping with charities which support young children in order to give them the best start in life. The mental health of children is high on her list of priorities.
