Benedict Cumberbatch is an updated, arguably more successful version of Huge Grant. He exudes the public school boy manner in much the same way. He is less handsome but is arguably the more versatile actor. I can't recall anything I've seen him where he has given a standout performance but he is often and heavily lauded. He plays one of the more forgettable reoccurring characters in the Avenger franchise. I guess Marvel studios paid him a lot of money for that pleasure. I hope he is a natural redhead.
