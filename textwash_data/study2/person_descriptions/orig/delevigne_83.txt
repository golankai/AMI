Cara Delevingne began her modelling career at the age of 10 when she booked her first job for Vogue Italia. Fast-forward to 2012 when she officially had her career breakthrough as she walked for Chanel, Donna Karan, Tory Burch, Burberry, Moschino and more.

Best known for her eyebrows, Delevingne's rise to modelling fame seemed to inspire teenagers and adults alike to put down their tweezers. 

Despite her flourishing career, the 29-year-old took a hiatus from modelling to take her acting career seriously. She began her acting career alongside her modelling boom in 2012. After her hiatus in 2015, she started to receive more notable roles and has been in Paper Towns, Suicide Squad, Kids in Love and Pan to name a few.
