Cara Delevingne is a British actress and model from London. Although famous for her modelling and acting prowess, she recently came under fire on social media for her controversial 2021 Met Gala outfit. This included the words 'Peg the patriarchy' emblazoned across her chest. 

She was born to parents Pandora Anne Delevingne, and Charles Hamar Delevingne on 12th August 1992, and has three siblings; two older sisters, Poppy and Chloe Delevingne, and a paternal half brother, Alex Jaffe.

She attended both Francis Holland School for Girls in London and Bedales School in Hampshire. She found school challenging though, due to Dyspraxia - a condition that affects physical coordination.
