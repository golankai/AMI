Everybody knows Kate Middleton. She is the embodiment of Cinderella, a commoner that has caught the attention of a prince. 

She is the definition of elegance and grace. Every time you google her, you will not see a single photo of her not in her best self. 

She is a fashion icon. Remember her simple lacy wedding dress? Well, every bride-to-be has envisioned themselves wearing the same one. All the wedding dress designers must have been tired of hearing their clients request for the same thing all over again. But you can't blame them. It is simple yet timeless.

She is also famous for recycling her dresses. What a sustainable route! Truly a fashion icon.
