Lewis Hamilton, British racing driver extraordinaire, has just become the first man to record 100 wins in F1 Grand Prix racing. At 36, his natural talent has made him the most successful driver in the history of the sport, on track for a record breaking 8th Championship win. His success has brought him riches, with Forbes estimating his net worth at Â£260m. Being of mixed race and identifying as black, Hamilton has suffered racist abuse throughout his career and is an advocate against racism in sport and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. He is a vegan and is vocal on environmental and animal rights issues. In 2008, he created The Lewis Hamilton Foundation to support a wide number of charitable causes. He was knighted in the 2020 Honours List for his outstanding achievements and contributions to motorsports.
