Sam smith is an English singer song writer and performer. Sam recently came out from being a gay man to a non binary person and likes to be referred too as they/ them rather than he like they were used too. I think Sam is in their late twenties, nearly thirty. They sing in a very high pitch and I think they may have had a James Bond them tune. I donâ€™t know them well but I think they have won a lot of awards and are very popular. Sam smith is very famous and probably gets played a lot on radio 1 with current music that younger people like.
