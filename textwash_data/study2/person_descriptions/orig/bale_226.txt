I know he plays batman and he is pretty attractive, although I've heard that he is not a very nice person. He has an attractive face but as a real person he doesn't have an attractive personality, treating other people badly. He is an outstanding actor, being in many films, such as Batman and American Pyscho. He is able to portray different characters thoroughly. He is British, I believe but often plays american characters. He is well known by many, famously for his acting (of course) but has been described to be hard to work with and often causing arguments however a lot of the time it is due to how dedicated he is as an actor, a perfectionist.
