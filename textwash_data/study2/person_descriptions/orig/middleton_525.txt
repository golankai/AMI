Kate Middleton married Prince William after having met as students at St Andrews University. I want to say she was studying Art History. She has at least two siblings who seem to enjoy the media spotlight. Besides being a mother and doing charity work, I know little about her. She like her husband seem not to have aged terribly well, although she has maintained a svelte physique throughout her time in the public eye. I believe her father is a business man and she grew up in the home counties. I believe she is generally well thought of by the public, although why she or anyone else would want to marry into the Royal family seems more baffling with every passing year. Besides the Queen, and the recently deceased Prince Phillip, they all seem to be lacking in substance.
