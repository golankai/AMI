Jk rowling is an author of the popular novels, harru potter. Jk rowling is a female in her 50s who enjoys writing about magic mystery. Her novels were a great success with all ages and then became hit films staring daniel Radcliffe ans Emma Watson.
Jk rowling has won many many awards for her books and illustrations.
Although jk rowling hasnt confirmed she will continue nor stop writing. The Harry Potter sequals have now come to an end and therefore i feel she should not spoilt her reputation by writing something which isnt as popular or as exciting as the harry potter sequals.
