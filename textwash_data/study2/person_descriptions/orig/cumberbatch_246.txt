Benedict Cumberbatch is a British actor perhaps most famous for his role as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC miniseries and later Dr Strange in a series of Marvel films. He’s stared in numerous film, TV and radio roles, and many stage appearances, often playing a slightly remote, upper-class or aristocratic Englishman. In appearance, he is recognisable for a shock of dark hair and a long, angular, brooding, expressive face. Politically, he has spoken out against the UK government’s response to the migrant crisis and against the Iraq war. He’s also a supporter of LGBTQ rights.
