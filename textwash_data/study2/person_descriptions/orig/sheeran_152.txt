Ed Sheeran is an English singer-songwriter, who rose to prominence in the 2010s through his mainly acoustic-pop songs. He has sold hundreds of millions of records and at his peak was touring the world with his biggest album to date : ‘Divide’. (All his albums follow the theme of being a mathematical symbol) 
His personal life has raised a slight controversy, particularly surrounded his lavish country home, which has caused disputes with councils and neighbours surrounding the legitimacy of planning permissions for ponds - that have been reported to be used as pools during one of his many large parties held.
