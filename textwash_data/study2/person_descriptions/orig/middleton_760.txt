Kate Middleton is 31 years old, and is a teacher. She teaches 7 year olds and loves her job. She is always coming up with new fun things for them to do. She lives in a little cottage in a village, with her husband and little girl. She is not having anymore children. Once a month, she meets up with her girl friends from University and they go to the pub quiz and have a few drinks. Her team always wins. Every Saturday her and her husband take their little girl to the park. Next year they have a holiday planned to Greece, their daughters first holiday. Kate used to go there when she was little with her family, so is excited to take her daughter and husband.
