J.k.rowlings real name is joanne Rowling. She is a author who most famously wrote harry potter. The books were made into films and she made millions upon millions of pounds. She is on the forbes rich list. She writes crime books also under a false name. She has had some controversy lately i think involving the lgbtq community. She is very outspoken with her political views and has openly donated to the Labour party. I think she lives in Scotland now. She is very opinionated and although i dont know a great deal about her i often see her name pop up in news articles for her very outspoken and controversial views
