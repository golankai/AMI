Kate Moss is an absolute legend. She is THAT iconic celebrity from the 90's that I can still picture being in every single media outlet from dusk till dawn. She is beautiful, she is elegant, and she is THE PERSONIFICATION OF COOL! When I think of Kate Moss, I think of London, and not just any London, the London that everyone wants to be a part of, whether it's the high streets and the fashion and the arts and all the glitter and fame, but also the other London, smokey, run-down streets that really grows on you, once you live there. She is the queen of London and totally deserves the moniker. Her face is iconic, her figure is fabulous and she will own every piece of garment/clothing you throw at her with no problem!
