Kate Middleton is known as the Duchess of Cambridge. She is a member of the royal family and is married to Prince William, The Duke of Cambridge. They met in their younger days, when they were students, and got married in Westminster Abbey in 2011. Prince William and Kate Middleton have three children: Prince George of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Prince Louis of Cambridge. Kate is often compared to Princess Diana because of both her generosity and volunteering work and her sense of fashion. Kate loves sports and that is why we can see her often at sports events, such as Wimbledon.
