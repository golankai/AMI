I would say Naomi campbell is a complex character. She has had a long career with the media and has been presented as temperamental, rude, diva and hard to work with. 
I think she has worked hard and been very focused to achieve a lot of things in her life and is beautiful and glamourous. 
She has worked hard for many causes that are close to her heart and has worked tirelessly to get where she has. She has tried her hand at many things and I think she is very hard working, she seems to have a good appetite for risk and is happy to chase what she wants
