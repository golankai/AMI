Jk Rowling is a British author known for her Harry Potter book and film series, I begrudgingly writing anything about this person as they are transphobic and not a very nice person. I really don't know what to say about her that would be worth reading and could contribute to this study. I personally feel that with outdated and dangerous viewpoints like this her products and such should be stripped from the media and not allow her to make money from her products anymore as she could use this money to further her dangerous agenda and views
