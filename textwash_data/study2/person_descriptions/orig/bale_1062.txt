Christian Bale is a British actor commonly known for his role in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Triology as Batman as well as his role in American Psycho as Patrick Bateman. Bale's notability also arises from his ability to undergo huge physical transformations for his roles, often losing and gaining large amounts of weight as necessary for a particular role.

Born in 1974 in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire in the UK, Bale decided to become an actor at age ten after securing his first acting role at age eight in a commercial for fabric softener.

A common misconception is that Christian Bale is actually American due to his excellent accents and impersonations.
