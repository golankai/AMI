Ricky Gervais is a bearded comedian and animal rights activist. 
He is British but lives in LA. He wrote and starred in The Office which was a mockumentary set in Slough about a terrible manager and his team who despised him.  His Instragram account is mainly about animals and his pets and his partner Jane who he describes as having 'no friends'.
He has a west country accent even though I don't think he's actually from the west country. 
He's a bit marmite- you either love him or hate him. He's hosted lots of awards ceremonies and pissed people off with his jokes. 
He is completely anti animal testing, animal cruelty and eating animals. 
He's going on tour soon. 
He also wrote a series that was about being an agent for famous people and got lots of famous people to star in it with him including David Bowie.
