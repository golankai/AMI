Christian Bale is one of the most famous actors of his generation, with a career spanning from American Psycho, to Batman films, The Big Short, and Vice. He is famous for being a method actor, especially for gaining and losing weight to ensure he looks the part - he was very athletic for the Batman roles for example, then later gained weight to play Dick Cheney in Vice. Not many people know he's actually from Wales as even in interviews he often sounds American. There is an urban legend of him being really unpleasant to work with, with film crew often complaining of his temperamental outbursts.
