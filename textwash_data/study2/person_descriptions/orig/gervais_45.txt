Ricky Gervais is an English actor. I recently saw him in the Netflix show ""After Life"". I think Ricky Gervais could be described as a comedian. But in ""After Life"", he played a very different role, having just lost his wife and trying to find meaning in life again. 
I don't think Ricky Gervais has the kind of physical attributes that I would recognise him in the street. He seems slightly over-weight, middle-aged, perhaps unshaved. 
Wikipedia says Ricky Gervais did a degree at the University College London. I had no idea how successful he was. Ricky Gervais has won plenty of awards including British Comedy Awards, Emmy Awards, and Golden Globe Awards.
