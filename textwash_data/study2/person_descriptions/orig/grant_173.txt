British actor, most famous for his roles in romantic comedy films - such as Bridget Jone's Diary, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. These films were all made during the 90s/early 2000s which is probably the point at which he was most relevant. His popularity took a steep decline after being arrested in the US with a prostitute with him in his car. He was also a prominent character in the News of the World phone hacking scandal and I believe he gave evidence to the Leveson enquiry. He speaks with an incredibly posh voice and lots of his more famous characters are notable for speaking with a bit of a stutter and seeming somewhat uncoordinated.
