Daniel Craig is most famous for his role as James Bond 007 in the Bond movies.  He is probably not very tall (I am unsure, but he ""seems"" short!) has blond hair and blue eyes, has a round face, almost a babyface.  Even though as Bond he is playing a man who is considered tough, perhaps unemotional, I think his face looks kind.  He is usually clean shaven.  When I think of him I imagine him wearing a typical Bond outfit of a dinner jacket, ready to charm some ladies.  When I think of him I also remember the scene from one of his movies where he comes out of the sea.
