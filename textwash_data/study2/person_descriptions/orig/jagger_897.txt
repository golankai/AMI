I do not know who Mick Jagger is all I know is that Kesha sings a song with him in. The lyric is “kick him to the curb unless he look like Mick Jagger”. I believe he is British and has Sir in his name and was maybe a member of the Rolling Stones or a similar band? I do not think he has the best reputation- think he may be a bit of a druggy and party animal. I’m not sure how to make this 500 characters when I don’t know who it is! I’m finding it really difficult to write about him I have run out of things to say
