Kate Moss is a former supermodel who is also a business entrepeneur owning several businesses and clothing lines. Kate was the attractive woman that most likely decorated many bedroom walls throughout the 1990s especially during her rise to fame though I'd say that her reputation as a buinesswoman and overachiever far exceeds her supermodel years. She has also ventured musically by co-writing a number of songs and appearing in several music videos over the years. Unfortuantely Kate Moss has also slipped into the dark side of fame by appearing in the spotlight a few times with a number of drug allegation stories too which resulted in her being dropped from a number of famous ad campaigns which undoubtedly impacted her financially.
