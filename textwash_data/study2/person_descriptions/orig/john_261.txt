Elton John is an extremely successful singer in his 70s.  When I picture him I imagine his flamboyant style.  He often wears large sunglasses or other large glasses.  He is married to David Furnish, I recall that they adopted a son from Russia, after being told that Elton was too old to adopt a child in the UK.  Elton John is something of a national treasure in the UK, although I have a feeling he lives in the United States now.  I associate him with the 1970s, huge flares and platform shoes.  Some of his most famous songs include crocodile rock, tiny dancer and the song for Princess Diana, candle in the wind.  A few years ago a film about his early life came out.  The way he met his writing partner and the way they worked together was very moving.
