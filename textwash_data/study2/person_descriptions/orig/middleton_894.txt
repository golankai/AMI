Kate Middleton is part of the British royal family. She is married to Prince William whom she met in university. They later got married in a fairytale wedding and went on to have three children together. She suffered with extremely severe morning sickness throughout all of her pregnancies. She is always well put together and immaculately dressed. Making frequent public appearances, she always comes across really well - polite, approachable and caring. She seems to be popular and well liked by the public, as is her husband William. She comes across as much more down to earth than many of the other royals.
