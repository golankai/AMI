Cara Delevigne is an English model, actress, and singer. Her acting debut came in the 2012 film Anna Karenina, and she has since had notable roles in the films Paper Towns (2015) and Suicide Squad (2016). 
Beginning in the late 2000s and into the early 2010s, Delevigneâ€™s modelling career took off, including in her walking at New York Fashion Week in 2012. She has subsequently had a strong relationship with Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld (until his death in 2019). Since 2015, she has taken a more selective approach to which modelling endeavours she agrees to, becoming something of a hiatus whilst other career paths take off.
