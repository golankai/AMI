I would say Ricky gervais is a well known house hold name. He’s a comedian, actor, director, producer and writer. He is best known for the office, but actually started his career as a pop star in the 80s. Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. Ricky gervais is a vegetarian  and  has a long term partner but does not intend to get married. In 2002 he was involved in a charity boxing match and donated the £5,000.00 prize money to the training of a Macmillan nurse to specialise in cancer. He has openly stated her will be leaving his fortune to animal charities. In 2015, Gervais donated a signed acoustic guitar to help raise funds for Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario, Canada.
