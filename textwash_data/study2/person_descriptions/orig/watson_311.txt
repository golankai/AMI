I am not so familiar with emma Watson. I have seen her grow up in the public eye and she makes me think of harry potter. 
I have more recently seen clips of her representing womens views and campaigning for womens rights. She comes across as a strong, independent woman. 
I also saw her speak about not being married and not having children and the pressures on women to confirm and do these things by certain ages. She came across as very confident, well spoken and very clear on her thoughts and got them across well without being confrontational or rude.
I would say she comes across as very likeable
