My first memories of Christian Bale is in the film little woman. He stared in one of my favourite films, The prestige. The only roles that I know of aside from this is his roles in Batman. He is married with two children and has lived in USA since 1990 and is a citizen of the USA. He has been vegan since 7 years old but admitted in 2014 that he doesnâ€™t not do it fully anymore. He became vegan after watching charlottes web. Bales dad died in 2003 from a Brain condition. Bale wanted to become an actor since the age of 10.
