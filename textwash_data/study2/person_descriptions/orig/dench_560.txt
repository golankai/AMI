Versatile actress, who has started in Bond Films, and Shakespearean dramas. I think she has been in Macbeth & Romeo & Juliet. 

From Yorkshire. Her daughter is an actress but I'm not aware of what her husband does. Another actress who isn't often in the news, so I imagine that she likes her private.l life to be private.

Wrote an open letter against Scottish independence.

Another person I'm not overly familiar with, but again someone who is immediately identifiable as a classic British actress
