Sir Elton Hercules John CH CBE, born Reginald Kenneth Dwight, is a British singer, songwriter, composer and pianist. He was born on the 25th March 1947 in Pinner, Middlesex. 

Described as a child prodigy on the piano, teaching himself how to play the instrument aged 4, John obtained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music aged 11. As he gravitated towards pop music after discovering rhythm and blues, he joined the band Bluesology in the mid-1960s. He then met his major songwriting collaborator, Bernie Taupin, after both he and John responded to an advertisement in a magazine. 

In 1969, John released his debut album, Empty Sky, which was followed by his first hit single, Your Song, in 1970, taken from his second album, Elton John. Additionally, John has seen success in musical theatre, composing for The Lion King and Billy Elliot the Musical. 

John's illustrious career has seen him earn five Grammy Awards and five BRIT Awards, as well as two Golden Globes, two Academy Awards and a Tony Award. Rolling Stone Magazine, in 2004, ranked John as 49th on its list of the 100 most influential musicians of the rock and roll era. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 for his ""services to music"" and his philanthopy.
