I do not have much of an opinion of Daniel Craig, as truthfully I have not seen many of his films. I know that when he was cast as James Bond, a lot of people thought he was too boring and did not have enough emotion, and they kind of blew him off before he even started. I was too young to know that at the time, but reading about it now makes me feel sorry for him, because everyone deserves a chance. I don't think he's boring, or emotionless. I think he is stoic and British, and I think he plays his part perfectly: although that might be because he is always cast as the same kind of role? I do find him funny, and I loved when he got involved in the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics and kind of poked fun at himself - that's the mark of a funny and a confident person, and I do like that about him
