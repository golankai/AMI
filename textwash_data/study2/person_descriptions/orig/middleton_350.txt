oh , the one who married william. the one whose husband is a repetition of his father and cheated on her. the one who had like three kids and seemed fine when leaving the hospital for PR purposes. the one who was idolised by the media , whilst Meghan was destroyed. the one who will be the future queen of england , besides her husband. the one who everyone branded as the ""commoner"" , girl please shut up , she was born into a wealthy family with a lot of privilege. the one with the beautiful wedding dress which was based off of grace kelly's wedding dress, that was designed by sarah burton, who is the designer of Alexander Mcqueen... a classic british luxury brand. however kelly's dress was made by her costume designer and friend , Helen Rose, not a brand despite it , arguably, being the biggest wedding of the century.
