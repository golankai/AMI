Naomi Campbell is an ageing super model. Obviously, being a super model she still looks fabulous and I believe she recently became a mother. I am unaware who is the father of the child, or if indeed there is a father. She is known for her outspokenness and having  barbarous tongue. She projects the aura of someone who does not tolerate fools gladly. I imagine she is now involved in charity work and as a success strong female figure she is probably a considerable role model for many other women.
