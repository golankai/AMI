Kate Moss is a famous British supermodel who rose to fame through her collaborations with Calvin Klein in the 1990s. She was born in Croydon, United Kingdom. She was criticised for her hard partying lifestyle as well as for her ultra thin physique, which some speculated was due to an eating disorder, which Moss denied. Kate Moss is also known for a style called ""heroin chic"" which reflected the culture around the use of the drug taking place in the 1990s. This style featured thin physiques, stringy hair, and dark eye circles, and was a reaction to the style of modeling predominant in the 1980s that featured more curvaceous women. In addition to her work with Calvin Klein, Kate Moss has worked with a multitude of luxury fashion houses such as Chanel and Burberry. She has one daughter.
