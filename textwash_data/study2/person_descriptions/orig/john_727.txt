Born Reginald Dwight in 1947, Elton John is a multi-award-winning singer/songwriter with a dazzling career spanning more than five decades. He is especially well known for his energetic performances and flamboyant personality. 

His accolades are many, but notably include winning Best British Male Artist at the BRIT awards in 1991, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and a knighthood awarded to him by Queen Elizabeth II for his 'Services to music and charitable services' in 1998. 

His success has not been without challenges, as documented in the 2019 hit biopic 'Rocketman' produced by his husband, David Furnish. Earlier in his career, Elton suffered from addiction to both drugs and alcohol. In 2019 he celebrated 29 years of being clean and has publicly supported other stars who face similar struggles.
