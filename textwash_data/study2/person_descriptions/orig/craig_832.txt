Daniel Craig is an English actor who has had most of his success come from performing his role as the iconic 007 character James Bond whom many place as being the best to do it since Sean Connery. Despite the success he's had with the role of James Bond, he's been very open in the past as to his dislike of the character for being overly masculine to an exagerrated and unrealistic level. Ironically his debut as the Bond character came under much critiscism before the film even hit cinemas as he was the first ""blonde Bond"" where as all previous actors who portrayed the character were dark haired or brunette. The success of Casino Royale catapulted Daniel Craig's level of fame with even the film's hit single ""You Know My Name"" produced by Chris Cornell receiving high praise. The peak of Daniel Craig's 007 role came during the release of Skyfall which was considered by many fans to be the best Bond film ever made with the film's unique approach to mix some of the old school 1960's Bond-like charm with a modern day gritty setting and one where Bond was portrayed as being quite vulnerable for a change rather than untouchable.
