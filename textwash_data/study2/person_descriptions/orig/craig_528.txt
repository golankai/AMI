Daniel Craig is famous because of his piercing blue eyes and playing British icon James Bond. Whilst being Bond has been a milestone in his career he is also renowned for not wanting to play Bond anymore. In an interview he said he would rather be violent towards himself than play the character again. Since saying this he has reprised his role as Bond at least twice and seems okay. Another Bond film is due to be released soon titled 'No Time To Die'. He married 'The Mummy' actress Rachel Weisz in 2011 and they remain married to this day.
