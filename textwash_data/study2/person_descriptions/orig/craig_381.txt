Daniel Craig is the best James Bond to ever exist. (Yes I've seen Sean Connery, and while he is undoubtedly iconic, I think Daniel's personification of 007 is damn realistic and almost cold-blooded, that's how a real killer agent is supposed to act and look). Daniel Craig is immensely athletic, handsome with a wonderful dry humour, that you can really pick up once you've seen an interview or two of his. He is a wonderful actor, and it's a shame a lot of people don't know his other roles. But I guess once you are James Bond, that really sticks on you for life. I could imagine Daniel Craig being on of the founding members of an iconic band like the Beatles back in the 60's. He really has got that vibe that he carries around, a very interested and a talented human being.
