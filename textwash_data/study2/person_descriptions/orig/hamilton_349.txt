A fucking icon. the winner of practically ever F1 race ever.was born into a working class family and genuinely built his way up. is so successful that his is criminalised by the racing industry for the dumbest things. oh and he got an MBE from the queen , obviously. was in mclaren before signing an exlcusive with mercedes. He was persuaded by a icon in the industry who passed away a few years ago. his team mate bottas , for now next season he is going to a different team, is just their to boost him, in every instance bottas is put second , that's fucked up ...but that is the politics of the racing industry. he is the face of mercedes so of course he would be put first for everything else. i dont blame bottas for anything , but his team were too over their head when they signed their contract. lives and has his PUBLIC assets registered in monaco, because its a racing mecca and heaven for tax purposes. he is sponsored by so many groups , mercedes, sony for a while , LG i think and then LV adored him , because of virgil abloh but whatever, and any other luxury company in the world to be fair.
oh and the guy who paid over 300 thousand pounds for a table at the MET 21 to invite black designers, he was styled by Luxurylaw , a iconic stylist and he looked amazing. had nothing to do with the theme, but neither did most of the outfits that night so who really cares.
dated so many models , i lost track and care , not that it was there to begin with...rihanna , B palvin, winnie harlow, sofia richie , minaj...the only ones i know of
