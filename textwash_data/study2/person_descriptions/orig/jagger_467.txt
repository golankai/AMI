Sir Mick Jagger is one of the Rolling Stones and he was the voice of them! He is still alive and his quite a lot children and many wives. Many people who like that type of music would call him a legend. I think he was known for being quite scandalous back in the day. He wrote most of the songs for the band including the brilliant (I canâ€™t get no) Satisfaction. Mick Jagger is 78 years old and had a child with his fifth wife in 2016. Mick was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2003 for his services to popular music.
