Omg I love Ricky Gervais. My favourite programme is after life on Netflix as it was just one of those comedy’s that don’t give a fu*k what people think it’s just about the comedy! I believe he is quite well known for being rude to other though which I can kinda see. He also wrote and starred in the sit com the office! But I have only seen the US version which is weird haha! I think a lot of people prefer the UK version but I just have never got into it. Can you believe he is 60 though?? He don’t look that old to me haha. He must be very clever to write and co star in these programmes as they are very witty
