Again Daniel Radclif makes me think of Harry Potter. I think he seems very grounded and  hard working. He has again grown up on the screen and it must have been difficult at lots of points. 
His success has been massive for a young man and he has worked hard to move onto other roles, the theatre etc. 
He seems steady, hard working, likes to challenge himself and seems nice and likeable.
He seems to present as a professional that would be good to work with. He has had big success and seems hard working
