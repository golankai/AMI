Kate Middleton is a very popular Duchess from the British royal family. She has birthed many children in the recent years. She is very pretty and very rich. She is married to Prince William. She often wears funny hats during important ceremonies. She is what one would call a modern day Diana and one day her husband will be King (most likely). She does a lot of charity work and is a very important figure in international politics. People in England have a mostly favorable view of her which is quite remarkable knowing the general negative sentiment that people have towards the Royals or rich people in general.
