Hugh Grant is a British actor best known for his portrayals in romantic comedies such as Bridget Jones' Diary, Love Actually, and Notting Hill. Despite the fact many believed him to have genuine acting talents to provide, he is mostly recognised for these type-cast roles as the charming lead man, perhaps clueless but well-meaning. That being said, Grant has made his fair share of departures from the genre, taking on more serious roles but largely sticking to the comedy element. For these performances he has recieved praise for his willingness to tackle roles viewed as against-type, with many of his films making large profits.
