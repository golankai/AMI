How do I put this politely? David Beckham is a very sexy forty-something ex professional footballer. All the men with they were him and the women wish they were with him! He has been in the public eye for many years for being a very skilled and popular football player but also for dating and marrying the elusive Victoria Beckham aka Posh Spice from the Spice Girls. The cheeky London boy is most popularly known for playing for UK football team Manchester United with the number seven on his back (whom he named his first daughter after). He then later went on to play for the American team, Inter Miami - which he now owns. Aside from his skills on the pitch, David is known worldwide for being kind souled, funny and genuine guy. Just shy of 6ft, this blue eyed hunk has had many movie cameos, TV appearances and even a dab hand at modelling - no surprise there! Beckham is a household name and loved by everyone!
