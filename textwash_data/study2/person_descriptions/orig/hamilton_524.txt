Lewis Hamilton, is a racing car driver, brand ambassador and hair transplant success story. He racing Formula 1 race cars and is a multiple times world champion. I believe he's record stands up with the very best. However, he seems to lack the charisma and the raw magnetism of the former stars of the sport, a la Senna and Schumacher. Rather, he comes across as a PR's dream, although the tax breaks he is undoubtably afforded residing in Monaco probably suggests he is perhaps not without his faults. He has been an active support of the BLM movement.
