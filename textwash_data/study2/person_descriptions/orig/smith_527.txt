Sam Smith is an Oscar winning singer who ascended to fame after featuring on Disclosure's song Latch. Sam is gender fluid and dons both men's and women's clothing. They have also come out as gay and dated two male celebrities: Jonathan Zeizel and Brandon Flynn. During quarantine, Sam uploaded a video of themselves crying as they expressed how hard the struggles of lockdown had been on their mental health. This gained no sympathy online, and people were quick to retort that the majority of people did not have such luxury to reside in.
