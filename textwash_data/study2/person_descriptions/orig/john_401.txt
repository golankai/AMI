A well known British middle aged stocky singer and musician with red hair. He is known for his camp and quirky costumes, crazy glasses and platform shoes both onstage and off stage. He has countless hit songs such as Rocket Man and Your Song and would be classed as a living legend. He recently had an Oscar nominated film made about his life, his music and his rise to stardom. His tours are just as extravagant as his sense of style and his performances although nowadays he dedicates more of his time to his charity work and his children.
