Adele is a British singer and songwriter. One of the world's best selling music artist, she is famous for the heartbreaking break-up songs that you used to (and maybe still do) sing loudly during late night car rides and very emotional hot shower moments. 

She has a very outgoing and jolly personality, judging from her Carpool Karaoke with James Corden. Is that a North Londoner accent that I'm hearing? Well, I am not sure where she came from, but that does sound like it. Oh, and that episode where she pretended to be a look-alike Adele! That was funny. She must be nice to be with. I'd like to be her friend.

She used to be on a bigger size, but with proper diet and exercise, she looks healthier and happier now. No body shame there, but damn, that was a good transition. What an icon! Self love conquers all!
