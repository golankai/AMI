Lewis Hamilton is an author seeking to write stories about, with and for children, which is why he is extremely successful. He started drawing when he was only three years old and carried that skill into story making for children. He next learnt how to create intellectual stories even children can understand. Finally, he had to grow as a person in order to have good morals and portray those lessons to children in a very lighthearted manner. With the inspiration of his family, friends and partner, he is one of the most world known authors in the world.
