Elton John is 74 years old, he lives alone in a small house. He doesn't cook, and survives of microwave meals and noodles. His favourite tv show is America's Got Talent and he watches re runs every night. Before he goes to bed he reads a few chapters of whatever book he is on. He has a friend who lives next door who comes to visit once a week, they play cards and smoke cigars. He goes to the supermarket every Sunday and buys the same things just to get out the house. His life is very routine. He has family but they don't live close by, so he doesn't see them. They call every once in a while, but never stay on the phone for long.
