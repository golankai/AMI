Naomi Campbell is a very successful model. Discovered at 15 she was one of the most recognisable faces of the late 80s and early 90s. She was able to continue her success far longer than many in her industry.  However throughout her career she has courted controversy. She has been convicted of assault on numerous occasions. Furthermore it is widely believed that she accepted blood diamonds from Charles Taylor. This kind of behaviour along with her cocaine addiction has tainted her previous success.
