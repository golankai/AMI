Sam Smith is a singer that I am not very familiar with. I suppose he is popular with young people and especially teen girls. I have listened to maybe one or two of his songs and it is mostly commercial-driven pop music that isn't very refined. Some have called him the McDonalds of popular british music. He isn't very talented. He has lots of tattoos and looks rather generic. Overall not a very important artist and he will most likely be forgotten in a few decades and be completely irrelevant in the industry and general domain of music.
