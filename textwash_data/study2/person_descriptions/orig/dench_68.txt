Dame Judi Dench is a National Icon! She is one of the most decorated actors, and has performed in a great breadth of productions, from stage to screen. She is a 7 time academy award winner, and has been in all sorts. She has starred in Shakespeare, and in James Bond films. One of her more recent productions was performing in the film cats, which was met with negative reviews globally, quite simply because it did not survive the transformation from stage to screen very well. However this does not put a dampner on her career - it is well known that any role she turns to she smashes. Her grandson used to post videos with her on TikTok over lockdown, asking her silly riddles and jokes.
