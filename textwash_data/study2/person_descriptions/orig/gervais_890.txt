Writer, stand-up comedian, actor, director, Ricky Gervais is probably best known for co-writing and starring in the documentary-style sit-com The Office. Gervais was born on 25 June 1961 and studied philosophy at UCL, where he gained a 2:1 degree. He went on to a career as a singer, before moving to comedy in the 1990s, and has never looked back. Amongst his many successes are “Extras” and his latest comedy series “After Life” a black comedy about a man dealing with grief following the death of his adored wife, which takes the watcher from utter heartbreak to stomach-aching laughter in each 30 minute programme. Genius. His hosting of the Golden Globe awards in 2020 is inspired and takes no prisoners. Hilarious.
