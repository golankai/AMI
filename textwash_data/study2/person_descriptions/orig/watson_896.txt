Emma Watson is a really likeable actress who played hermoine in Harry Potter. She must have a huge net worth because of her role in Harry Potter. I believe she was boring in Paris which is ironic because she reminds me of the programme “Emily in Paris” which is coming back for another season btw!! I think she is quite a well known actress but she must be at least 30 now which I find weird cos I kinda grew up watching Harry Potter but I’m only 20. She must have some famous names in her phone contacts hahahahaah
