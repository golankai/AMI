Emma Watson is another product of the lucrative Harry Potter franchise. She played Hermione, and like the film's other child stars grew up under the media spotlight. She has successfully parlayed her early fame into a series of later projects including multiple film roles in both mainstream and independent productions, modelling for Burberry and Lancome and acting as a 'UN Goodwill Ambassador'. She went to school at the Dragon in Oxford, which is nice, and has a degree from Brown in the States.
