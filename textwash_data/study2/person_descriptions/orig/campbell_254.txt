Naomi Campbell is a supermodel. She is best known for a stellar modelling career in the 19802-2000s, though has also acted and made an R&B studio album. She appeared on the cover of Elle magazine at the age of 16 and enjoyed a meteoric ascent of the British fashion scene. She has also released a bad ghost-written novel and invested in a restaurant chain which went disastrously bankrupt - its directors were arrested - but many of us make bad choices from time to time. Campbell has been an outspoken critic of racism in the fashion world and an activist in various fields.
