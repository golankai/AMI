Daniel Radcliffe is best known for his role in Harry Potter, which propelled him into stardom, but has led to him being somewhat typecast in that role. He has acted in other films since, but it is hard to throw off the thought that he is Harry Potter and I'm not sure how well these more recent films have fared. He started acting young and that's often the image I see of him, and retain in mind; a child. Seeing him more recently as a young man, with a beard has been a little weird to say the least. He has dark hair, and a youthful look.
