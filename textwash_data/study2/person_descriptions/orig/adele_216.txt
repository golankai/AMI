Adele is a British musician. She is famous world wide. All of her music has been written about heart break and she names her albums after her age and uses them as a diary. She seems to be very very genuine and comes across like the girl who lives across the street. The media have given her a really hard time over the years about her weight. She is married (i vaguely remember a divorce) and had a kid. She hasnt put out any new music in a long time. She was on james cordens car pool caraoke and was so funny and genuine. No other celebrities i have seen talk about her have anything bad to say about her. Id love to be her friend
