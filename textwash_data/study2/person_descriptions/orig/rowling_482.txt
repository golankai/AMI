Jk Rowling is a racist transphobic opportunistic sexist overrated plagiarist. She wrote a few good childrens books but looking at those books with a critical eye theres lots of strange things about the franchise. She claims Dumbledore is gay but never included that in either the books or the films and used it to claim the book was inclusive. the book features no LBGT characters and the only main asian character was called Cho Chang. She doesnt believe in equality and acceptance for transgender women and god knows what she thinks of gender non conforming people. Half the ideas in the book are better written in the Lord of the Rings series anyway so I really dont understand why people support that person.
