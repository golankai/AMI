This controversial yet successful British comedian is well known both in the UK and overseas. He rose to fame after writing and starring in the British tv series ‘The Office’ with his frequent collaborator Stephen Merchant, starring as the awkward and somewhat unlikeable David Brent - a character typical of his uncomfortable and realistic comedy. The series was later adapted into an American version and this comedian rose to fame in the USA. He is known for voicing his political views and more recently made a speech at the 2020 Golden Globes where he criticised the hypocrisy of the Hollywood film industry.
