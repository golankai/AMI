Emma Watson is a role model for many young women. She found fame in playing a character who touched so many young girls who were given a hard time for their smarts. She showed those girls that intelligence and bravery are more important that trying to fit in. And from that she has catapulted herself into an aspirational life. She still enjoys fame from multiple projects but she also took time out to go to university, and to become an ambassador for the UN. She is a proud feminist who speak eloquently and fiercely. For a young woman she has achieved so much, and we can expect much more from her in the future
