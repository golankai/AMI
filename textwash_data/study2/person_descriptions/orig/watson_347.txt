oh my god , that blonde girl. is she blonde? the harry potter one. watched her grow as a child. a prominent public figure for the feminist movement . went oxford , i think. was exposed by the panama papers. she basically got exposed for using mossack fonseca , the company in panama, to evade taxes and hide her identity...she attempted justifying it by saying she used it to hide where he house was from the public...i call bullshit because there are multiple ways to do so without evading taxes. if she was going to evade taxes she should just say so , its less pathetic.anyway... other ways to describe her?  is a fucking member of kering group, the company who own YSL gucci balenciaga Mcqueen (i would be here all day if i continued but you get the idea) anyway, she joined the board in a PR move to improve the branding of the group around sustainability....clearly the changes in the board members is working, a few days ago they announced that ""there was no room for fur in the fashion industry""....yeah i call bullshit on the 'good in their heart' because it was to improve their branding , not based on the morality on ethics of the situation. how surprising. if they cared about fashion and morality of it , they would use fur of animals who died of other causes, not animals who are commercially killed for the sake of the fashion industry. but anyway, she is on the board of the group for that.
