You’re a wizard Harry!! Daniel Radcliffe bagged one of the most famous roles of a millennials lifetime, the leading role to bring the beloved children’s books to the screen. He acted through his childhood and we watched him grow up on our screens. He has gone on to make several more movies and take to the stage. He has worked hard to shrug off the shadow of the boy who lived and seems to have done a good job of it. He’s still an icon and will always be that to people of a certain age group, but he has also shown us many other sides to him and his acting capabilities. In spite of his early fame he doesn’t seem to have fallen prey to a life of debauchery as many child stars do, and he presents himself as an incredibly charming and likeable young man
