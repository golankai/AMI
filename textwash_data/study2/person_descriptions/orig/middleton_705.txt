Kate Middleton to me looks very warm and kind. She is the Duchess of Cambridge, married to Prince William the Duke of Cambridge. She always looks put together when seen in the public eye but still manages to look open and kind. She has brown wavy hair with brown eyes and is average height for a woman. She was married in 2011 and has since had three children (Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis) with her husband Prince William. Kate Middleton seems to be well liked by the public and has little controversy surrounding her. Before becoming part of the royal family Kate was an accessories buyer with a British clothing chain
