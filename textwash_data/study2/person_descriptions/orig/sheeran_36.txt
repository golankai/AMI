Ed Sheeran is a British singer-songwriter. He was raised predominantly in Suffolk, England, and several of his songs refer to places and experiences he had there. Sheeran further draws on his time gigging, couch surfing and busking in his late teens. He found particular attention after the release of his song the A team, about a sex worker addicted to drugs. He has gone on to be one of the most widely known and best selling artists in the world. His original music was folk, folk-pop and has since made more popular music in part drawing folk into pop.
