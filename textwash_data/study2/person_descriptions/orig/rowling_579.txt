J.K Rowling is a British author, most famous for her Harry Potter series of books. The first of which was typed on an old manual typewriter in 1995. She submitted this to twelve different publishers and they all rejected it. It was a full year later before Harry Potter secured a publishing deal, with a mere Â£1,500 advance. J.K Rowling had a poor upbringing and now makes it her mission to support various charities through her work. She reportedly lost her billionaire status through donations she made to charity.
