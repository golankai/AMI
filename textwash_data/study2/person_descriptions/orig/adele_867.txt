Adele is one of my favourite female recording artists, with a very distinctive voice and style. She has sold over 120 million records during her career and has received an MBE amongst many other music awards. She was born Adele Adkins in 1988 in Tottenham. Her first album was entitled 19 and was released in 2008 and in 2009 she won awards for the Best New Artist & Best female pop vocal performance at the Grammys. Sadly as is the way if the world more recently focus has been more centred on her sudden and dramatic weight loss rather than her amazing talent.
