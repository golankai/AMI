British, very funny actor in his 60s. In Bridget Jones diary, Notting Hill, four weddings and a funeral and Love Actually and mainly in romantic comedies. He has brown hair and quite a versatile actor also in action films. His most recent film I've seen him in is The Gentleman which was a very funny film. Very entertaining. He's won many awards such as Golden Globes, BAFTAs and an honorary Cesar. My favourite Hugh Grant film is Music and Lyrics with Drew Barrymore. He is married and born in London. His breakthrough was in Four Weddings and A Funeral a classic romantic comedy from 1994. He has played many characters where he has tried to stay positive despite having a string of troubles.
