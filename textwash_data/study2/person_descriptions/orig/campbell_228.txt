Naomi Campbell is a black british model, actress and singer (I think). She rose to fame in the early 80s i think. becoming a very sucessful model, because she is beautiful. She is loved a lot by the British public, almost everyone in Britain  knows who she is. She has been on a few model TV shows trying to find models and i know she is well-known for speaking out a lot and speaking her mind, not afraid to say what she is directly thinking. She is still currently modelling, doing a lot for BLM and young black children, makin g the black voice heard in the modelling industry.
