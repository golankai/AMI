Elton John is a famous British musician, openly gay, baller at piano, hell of a singer - a dude I'd hang out with. Red head, has had a long and great career. Is way older than I thought he was?? Wouldn't think the dude is in his 70s to look at him. Seems like a fun dude to be around, good to have parties. One of the few British icons that I have no shame in enjoying. Had a movie made about him as a young lad made fairly recently. Sometimes pops up in movies himself. His middle name is Hercules which is extremely funny to me. Dude is based, pissed off some Christians once because he said Jesus was a cool dude.
