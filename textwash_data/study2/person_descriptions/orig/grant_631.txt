Hugh Grant is a well known British actor, he is a well spoken and handsome man who has floppy brown hair and pale skin. Due to his handsome appearance, he often plays roles in romance films, or romantic comedies. He overcame a public embarrasment when he was caught with a prostitute some years ago, by simply admitting fault and being open and honest about his actions. His audience seemed to appreciate this as these actions made him more likeable and genuine and he was ultimately forgiven by the public.
