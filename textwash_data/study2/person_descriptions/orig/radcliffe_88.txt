British actor, Daniel Radcliffe, 32, rose to fame as a child in the Harry Potter film series, in which he played the title character, Harry. Viewers watched him grow up on screen over the 8-film series, which he starred in from age 12 to age 22. 

When he was 17, in a bid to prevent himself being typecast, Radcliffe starred in the play, Equus, as the lead character Alan Strang. He received widespread critical acclaim as well as some controversy because he starred in a nude scene during the play.

Radcliffe, who is a Labour supporter, has a long term partner, Erin Darke, who is also an actress.
