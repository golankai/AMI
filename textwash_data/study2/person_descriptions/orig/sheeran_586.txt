He plays the guitar and writes and sings songs.  Personally I don't think he's very good, but it seems I'm in the minority.  He's famous for having ginger hair and lots of tattoos.  He's had several hit albums and lots of hit singles.  He recently played at the Global Citizen live concert.  He's also written songs for other people like Taylor Swift.  He has an MBE.  According to wikipedia he's worth Â£200 million.  
Apparently he often gives his clothes to charity shops, but it looks like he bought them there in the first place.  My husband calls him the homeless busker.
