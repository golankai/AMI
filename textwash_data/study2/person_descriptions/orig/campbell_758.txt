Naomi Campbell is a 40 year old business woman. She has no children, and works everyday. Even when she is not at work, she is at home working. Answering phone calls and emails. She owns her own finance business. She lives in a penthouse on her own, because she is too busy to date or have a relationship. Her only friends are from the office, and they are not real friends just business work associates. She does not see them outside of work. She texts her family every now and then, but does not see them.
