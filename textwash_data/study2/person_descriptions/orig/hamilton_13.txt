Lewis Hamilton is a 7 time world champion British Formula 1 driver.  He is one world championship away from breaking the world record of the most world championships won by one person. Hamilton also has 100 race wins under his belt after winning last week's Grand Prix. 
Hamilton is also a sports personality of the year winner in 2020 so his efforts in F1 have been highly rewarded. 
The F1 driver also was one of the first to advocate for Black Lives matter in F1. He worked closely with the 'End Racism' campaign to make the public aware of the racism which polluted F1 as well as every part of our lives.
