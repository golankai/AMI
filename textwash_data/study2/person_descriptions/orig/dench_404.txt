This female actor is one of the most famous British Shakespearean actors of all time. Although she is now quite elderly she has had a lengthy and diverse acting career varying from performing Shakespeare on the theatre stage to M in the James Bond film franchise. She has been acting since the fifties and shows no sign of slowing down any time soon. She is well spoken and petite with a classical demureness about her but she also seems to have a cheeky smile and has been known to have a great sense of humour.
