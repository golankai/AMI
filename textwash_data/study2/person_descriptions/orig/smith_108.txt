Sam Smith is a famous singer with a great voice. They sang one of the james bond theme tunes and has a distinctive voice. They have now decided to not be known as he or she. I remember watching a car pool karaoke with James corden in which sam smith appeared and said that when they get married they want the beginning to be a funeral for their single selves and then a celebration for the new commited Sam Smith. Sam Smith won a critics choice brit award at the beginning of their career and was first know for the song ""Money on my mind""
