David Beckham is a famous footballer with a famous foot and a bend when kicking the ball. 
He played for Manchester United and then in Spain and the US and he now manages a team himself. 
He is married to Victoria who was 'Posh Spice' in the Spice Girls and they have 4 children.
He's generally considered to be a 'good guy' but has been accused of adultery on several occasions and also apparently wrote an email that complained that he hasn't been given a knighthood yet. 
He is considered to be an attractive man and has done a lot of modelling and worn some very dubious clothes including matching outfits with his wife. 
He's apparently a bit of a clean-freak.
