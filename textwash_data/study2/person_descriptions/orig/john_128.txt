Elton John is a British singer / songwriter known for his work spanning several decades. He is well known for wearing his flamboyant outfits and incredible spectacles. 

Elton is often found seated behind a piano, and more often than not sits still during his performances. This is a stark contrast to his early days where heâ€™d often prance around the stage in sequinned outfits and incredible wigs. 

Elton has collaborated with a number of well known artists and has had more number one singles than one can count.
