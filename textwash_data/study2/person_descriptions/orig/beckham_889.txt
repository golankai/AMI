David Beckham is a retired footballer, who started his career with Manchester United in 1992 and went on to play for Real Madrid and LA Galaxy, amongst others. One of his most difficult times was in 1998, when he was sent of during the England Argentina match. He has since spoken about the affect the brutal backlash had in his mental health as a young 23 year old player. He is equally famous for his changing hair styles, being married to Posh Spice, Victoria, and for his mention in the film Dealpool, where he was the subject of a send-up because of his slightly squeaky voice. He also a appeared in a hilarious promo for Deadpool 2, in which Ryan Reynolds tried to apologise for the reference. All credit to him for being such a good sport. He has 4 children with Victoria; Brooklyn,  Romeo, Cruz and Harper.
