Mick Jagger is a snake hipped, big lipped, paging rock star and Rolling Stone. He's got about 50 kids from about 7 different women. HE's in his late 70s which is amazing given the amount of sex, drugs and rock and roll he must have had, taken and lived. 
He has made some of the best rock records of the last 60 years. 
He's a multi-millionaire and known for being sharp about continuing to make money from touring where tickets are really expensive. 
He's not obviously attractive so i can only assume that he has heaps of charisma in real life.
