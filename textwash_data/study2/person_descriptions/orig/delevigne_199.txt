Cara Delevinge is an English model, actress, and singer. She signed with Storm Management after leaving school in 2009, and won Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2012 and 2014. She wrote and recorded two albums of music under artist manager Simon Fuller and was subsequently offered a record deal. However, she turned the deal down due to the fact that her name would be changed. She also admitted in the past that she has dyspraxia and consequently found school challenging. In February 2013 she registered her name as a trademark.
