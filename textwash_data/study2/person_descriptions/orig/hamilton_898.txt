Lewis Hamilton is a sexy racing car driver. He is very famous in the UK but I am not sure about his international fame. I believe he has a lot of money though and I really wouldn’t mind be his side piece lol. I do recall his outfit at this years Met gala resembling my Nans net curtain and it was sort of like he was only half committed to the look cos he only had the net curtain round one leg. Or perhaps he forgot to tuck his shirt in the whole way round. I think it’s weird that relaxing car drivers are associated with major celebrities though
