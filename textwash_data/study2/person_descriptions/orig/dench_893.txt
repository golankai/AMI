Judi Dench is a British actress and absolute national treasure. She has had an extremely long career on both TV and in film, as well as on stage. Judi is probably best known, film-wise, for being in many of the James Bond films. In terms of her TV career, she starred in As Time Goes By across from TV husband Lionel. It was a comedy of a typical older married couple in Britain. On stage she has starred across from Sir Ian McKellen. Judi comes across really down to earth in interviews and has a great sense of humour.
