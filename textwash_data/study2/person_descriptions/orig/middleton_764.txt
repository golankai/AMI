Kate Middleton, or should I say The Duchess of Cambridge, is a fascinating individual. When she first exploded onto the scene as the girlfriend of the future king she was commonly referred to in the papers as ""waity-katy"" and seen as a bit of a social climber - pushed by her mother of course. Following her engagement and marriage to said future king in 2011 her image, as the future queen, has done a one-eighty. She is often seen as the model wife and mother, fashion magazines tell their readers where to buy her outfits and how to get her ""look"". Some die-hard royalists would consider her the most influential woman in all of the United Kingdom. However, rumours are swirling that she may not be the smiley, kind, and caring duchess she presents herself as behind closed doors. But alas, as mere peasants we may never get to know the truth about our future queen and current Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton.
