During Rowlings time on benefits she was also a single mother and described herself as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. At that time she also suffered from depression and had contemplated suicide. This is the time she was writing The Chamber of secrets. She took inspiration from her own life whilst writing this. Unfortunately in 1990 Rowlings mother passed away. Rowling channelled her grief through writing about Harryâ€™s grief for his mother.
