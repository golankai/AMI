Ed Sheeran's full name is Edward Christopher Sheeran, but he is definitely known as Ed Sheeran. I honestly believe that he doesn't need to be described because who doesn't know Ed Sheeran, huh? Ok, I will still do it. He is basically a 30 year old British singer, song writer record producer and actor. Known for his ginger hair, this young singer is one of today's best selling musician. His songs Perfect, Shape of you and bad habits are one of my personal favourites. He has been named the artist of the decade and also Spotify's most selling artist. Way to go!!!
