Mick Jagger born in 1943 is an extremely talented man - he is known for acting, producing, music and songwriting... there is not a lot he cannot do. He has had a performing arts centre named after him, and is so well known for his distinctive voice. He is in the same bracket as Rod Stewart and known for being a bit of a ladies man in his hey day, although settled down now. Born in Dartford, with over 4 partners and 8 children he has definitely lived an eventful life. I can picture him specifically in velvet jackets and a mullet type haircut.
