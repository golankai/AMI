Christian Bale is an actor, most known for protraying Batman and Patrick Bateman. Tall, dark haired, distinctive voice. Has dubbed for Ghibli films before. Lends himself well to dramatic and comedic performances and has a certain charisma on screen. Has one of those impressionable smiles. Tends to gain or lose weight for roles, changing physically to suit a role is a notable characteristic of his. I think he's in his late 40s? Definitely talented, if a little self destructive for his roles, though generally entertaining to watch as he has a good presence.
