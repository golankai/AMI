Daniel Radcliffe is an English actor best know for playing Harry Potter showing a curious mind. Going above and beyond to protect his friends always a little awkward. Wearing a wonderful scarf and lovely round glasses. He often inspired mixed emotions in the audience.
When I looked up Daniel Radcliffe's profile I found out that he is surprisingly small and very young. Apparently, he also played in movies such as The Woman in Black, Kill Your Darlings,  Victor Frankenstein, Swiss Army Man, and the Imperium
