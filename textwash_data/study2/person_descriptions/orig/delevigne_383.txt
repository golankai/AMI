When I think of Cara Delevingne, I always think of her raspy, sort of deep, cotton-feel voice. I believe I read somewhere that she was bound to become the new 'Kate Moss' of the new generation. Well, her figure is definitely something...She has THE perfect runway body, with long, slender legs and eyebrows to die for. Her face sexy and my god she is stylish, energetic, and has a goofy almost a dorky personality, which I rather find appealing. Her acting career did not quite peaked my interest, but after checking her IMDB filmography, I guess she's been busy.
