Kate Moss is an ex supermodel from the 90s, she would be in her late 40s now I think.  She was known for the 'waif' look as she was extremely thin and she started the popularity of that look on the catwalk as supermodels before her like Linda Evangelista for example had always had a few more curves.  She was known for partying a lot and was frequently photographed with a cigarette in one hand and a drink in the other.  She is from London.  Recently she has become sober I think and isn't in the spotlight much any more.  She has one daughter who is also a model and looks quite like her.  She used to go out with Pete Doherty.
