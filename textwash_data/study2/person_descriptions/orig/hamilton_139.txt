I only know Lewis Hamilton through his relationships, especially his relationship with Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls. I have never really followed his career, but from what I have heard of him, he is one of the top contenders in his sport, which is a feat in itself. He seems like a relatively quiet and reserved person, and as though he keeps to himself, but he is definitely one of the sports people that anyone could name, even if you really don't know anything at all about sports. He seems to be really talented, as I know a lot of people have died or been injured in racing, like he races, so you must have to be really brave in order to keep going on, even though you know there's a big risk. I think he seems like an intelligent man, and I think he is someone who is worth respecting and admiring because it is cleae that he works hard to get where he is
