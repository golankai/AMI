Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson is a British actress and activist. She was born on the 15th April 1990 in Paris, living in the French capital until the age of five. Watson's parents divorced when she was young, and so she moved to Oxfordshire to live with her mother. Here, she attended the Dragon School until 2003. Wishing to become an actress, she then trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, where she studied dancing, singing and acting.

While Watson was at school, the casting for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone had begun. The casting agents for the film had found Watson via her Oxford theatre teacher, and producers were impressed with her. Following a series of auditions, Watson was cast as Hermione Granger. The film was released in 2001. Watson starred as the character in all 8 films within the Harry Potter franchise, until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, in 2011. 

After Harry Potter, Watson has acted in several independent films and has also focused on her activism, as an outspoken feminist.
