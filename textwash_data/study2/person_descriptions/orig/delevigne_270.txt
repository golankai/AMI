She is an English model, actress, and singer. won Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2012 and 2014. She was at Victoria's secret for a long time after that she started acting and played in a couple of good movies. She is generous and funny. Her best acting was I believe in the movie called Paper Towns. As she models, she was in a lot of commercials which made people buy the products as she looked so beautiful. She sings plays the drums and the guitar. She has her own albums. She had her first modelling job at age ten which is quite early for someone. She has been in a busy schedule
