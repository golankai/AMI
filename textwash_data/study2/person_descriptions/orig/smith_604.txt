I didn't really know who Sam Smith was before this, but had heard the name. He is a singer-songwriter, whose music is classed as 'soul music and has short, brown hair and a beard. He is in his late twenties and is english. He seems a bit wet behind the ears, although in touch with his emotions. His appearance and style appear somewhat homosexual, and he has come out as gay, and also 'genderqueer'. He now wears makeup, in particular mascara and eyeliner. He sometimes wears earrings. He has won awards at prestigious music events.
