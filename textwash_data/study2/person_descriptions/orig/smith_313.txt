I think Sam Smith is Fun, good singer, bit crazy, out there, think he would be good company, good to party with, funny, good sense of humour. He is open about his sexuality, out spoken and a role model for other young people.

I love his songs and they are very modern, relevant and soulful.

I loved his appearance of carpool singing with james corden and i think his personality shone through. I really felt and saw his passion and I think this comes through strongly in his music too. I think he is a very likable person.
