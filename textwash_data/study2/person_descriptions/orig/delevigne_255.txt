Cara Delevingne is an actress. I must confess to not having heard of her before. She dropped out of school, but had a modelling career representing fashion brands such as Burberry and Fendi. Her modelling career seems to have tailed off a bit as she moved into films including Pan, Kids in Love, and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, none of which I have seen or heard of. She sounds rather self-absorbed but seems to have had an interesting if somewhat mercurial career. Despite being famous for wearing clothes and appearing in minor films, she has been named as one of the 1,000 most influential people in London; given that there are over 600 MPs alone, for example, this may be surprising, but there we go. I wish her well.
