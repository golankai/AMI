Ricky Gervais is a British comedian. He could be described as marmite as you either love him or you hate him. He is known, not only for his stand up, but for playing David Brent in the UK TV series The Office. In this Ricky plays the manager of an office that thinks he's a cool boss who everyone loves which is sadly not the case! His employees actually find him really annoying. More recently he played a slightly more serious role in Netflix series After Life - playing the main character whose wife died and how he deals with that. Ricky is a well known animal rights activist often taking to Twitter to voice his views on the subject.
