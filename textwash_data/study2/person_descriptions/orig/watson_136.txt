Emma Watson is one of the biggest figures of my childhood. She is a feminist which is my favourite thing about her, and as a child who absolutely loved reading and writing, it was so encouraging to see such an incredible and smart woman doing so well in the world. Emma Watson seems like a really nice person, she seems as though she is really caring and would pay a lot of individual attention to the people trying to talk to her. She was an inspiration to me when I was little, I wanted to be Hermione Granger so badly and I thought she was just the bravest person on the planet. I also have a lot of sympathy for Emma Watson, and what she experienced as a young woman due to the press and paparazzi. She was a really strong figurehead in representing everything that is wrong with our culture today, people were counting down to her birthday and when she would be ""legal"", and I've always felt so disgusted for her that she ever had to go through that.
