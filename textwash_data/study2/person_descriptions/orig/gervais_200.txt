Ricky Gervais is an English stand-up comedian, actor, director, producer and writer. He is best known for co-creating, co-writing and acting in the British television mockumentary sitcom The Office (which consequently was adapted into an American spin-off starring Steve Carrell). Before dipping into acting and creating tv series, Ricky Gervais initially worked in the music industry and attempted a career as a pop star in the 1980s. He is also a fervent supporter of gay rights and has praised the introduction of same-sex marriage in England and Wales as ""a victory for all of us"" and stated ""anything that promotes equality, promotes progress"".
