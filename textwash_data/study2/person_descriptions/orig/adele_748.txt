Adele Laurie Blue Adkins MBE is a British singer and songwriter. She has become an international success due to hits such as ""Rolling in the Deep"", ""Someone Like You"" and ""Hello"". Adele was born on May 5th 1988 in Tottenham, North London. 

Adele attended the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in May 2006, alongside other well-known British singers, namely Leona Lewis and Jessie J. Adele credits the BRIT School with nurturing her talent. She recorded a 3-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend, who posted the songs on the social media platform, MySpace. From here, RIchard Russell, head of the XL Recordings record label, got in touch and this resulted in Adele signing with the label.

Since then, Adele has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards and Billboard's Artist of the Year in 2011, 2012 and 2016. Time Magazine named her one of the most influential people in the word in both 2012 and 2016. Additionally, her second studio album, 21, released in 2011, was listed in Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2020.
