A beautiful man is Hugh Grant. 
English heartthrob and all round attractive man. 


Born in 1960 Hugh is 61 - it doesn't matter that I'm 34 - it's a yes from me. He's won several awards for the films he has appeared in which is testament to his talent in acting. Wiki states that his films have made more than US€3billion world wide. If I had €3billion I wouldn't mind a visit from Mr Grant. Haha. 
My favourite film of Hughs is music and lyrics. It's about a cheesy 80snsong writer and a sappy and unexpected working relationship turns romantic. It all kicks off over watering the plants. Yes Hugh, if you ever need a gardener/song writer companion I'm there with bells on.
