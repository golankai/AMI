David Beckham is one of the most famous football players of all time. He is arguably one of the biggest icons and/or sex symbols of the 1990s, in part also due to his marriage to Victoria Beckham, who was a 1990s icon in her own right as a member of the Spice Girls cult girl band. David has played for some of the most famous FA teams, most notably Manchester United. His career also includes Real Madrid and AC Milan. He was the Cristiano Ronaldo of the 1990s, achieving celebrity status wildly outside his area (sport) and raking in enormous profits from advertising campaigns and other participations.
