These include her rollercoaster relationship with Pete Docherty and her marriage to Jamie Hince. 
She has one child, a daughter, Lila, who was born in 2002. 
She has received awards for both modelling and her contributions to fashion. She was well known for her slender figure and being one of the most popular “size zero models”.
