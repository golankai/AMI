Naomi Campbell, born 22nd May 1970, is a British model, actress, singer and business woman. Born in South London to Jamaican-born dancer, Campbell has never met her father in accordance with her mother's wishes. Her surname Campbell is taken from her mother's second marriage as her biological father remained unnamed on her birth certificate. 

Naomi started her career at the age of 7, when she appeared in the music video for Bob Marley's 'Is this love'. Taking after her mother, Naomi originally planned to be a dancer, having studied dance from the age of 3 until the age of 16, tap-dancing in a Culture Club music video at the age of 12. 

Whilst at the Italie Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, Campbell was scouted by the head of the Synchro Model Agency, from which her career quickly took off, appearing on the cover of Elle at the age of 15. 

Her career continued to progress steadily and by the late 80's she formed a trio with models Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, often referred to as the 'Trinity'. This 'Trinity' became the most recognisable and in demand set of models of their generation.

By 1998, in which Time declared it the end of the supermodel era, Campell ventured into other career paths whilst continuing to model. These included cosmetics, frangrance, more music videos and acting. 

Alongside all of this Campbell has also been outspoken against the racial bias that exists in the fashion industry, joining fellow black models Iman and Bethann Hardison in an advocacy group called 'Diversity Coalition'. She is also involved in several charities including the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund.

Outside of the limelight Naomi has also covered newspaper pages having been convicted of assault on 4 occasions, having been accused 11 times. She made headlines again when she entered rehab for a cocaine drug and alcohol addiction.
