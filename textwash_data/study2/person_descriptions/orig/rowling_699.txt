J.K. Rowling is an English writer and screenwriter that has become   one of the best-known writers in the world for having written the Harry Potter fantasy book series. Harry Potter books have sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history, turning her author into a billionaire, after having lived on benefits. She also does charitable work and has established a Trust to combat poverty and social inequality.
She has had a difficult relationship with the press, especially British tabloids, and has declared herself a religious person, despite criticism from several religious organisations that objected to her books for what they understood was promotion of witchcraft.
