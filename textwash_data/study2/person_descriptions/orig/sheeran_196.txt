Ed Sheeran is often confused for Rupert Grint as they share eerily similar looks. He is a British singer-songwriter, record producer, musician, and actor. Sheeran has sold more than 150 million records worldwide. Even though he is best known for being an English singer, Ed Sheeran is actually Irish. Before making it big, Ed Sheeran ended up sleeping on the streets, on London Underground trains or on his friendsâ€™ sofas due to being unable to pay his rent. He is such a big lover of his instruments, that he has even gone as far as naming his guitars: Lloyd, Felix, Cyril, and Nigel.
