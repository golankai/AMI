Christian Bale is an English actor but he lives in America now.  He is tall with dark hair and kind of looks a bit evil but that's probably because of the roles he plays in films.  He was in The Machinist and played the psycho Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.  He really played his character well in The Machinist and was really convincing.  He also is in the Batman films.  He seems very dedicated to his craft as he goes through really extreme weight fluctuations in order to get into character.  He's a good actor.
