PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an actress. I must confess to not having heard of PRONOUN before. PRONOUN dropped out of school, but had a modelling career representing fashion brands such as ORGANIZATION_2 and ORGANIZATION_1. PRONOUN modelling career seems to have tailed off a bit as PRONOUN moved into films including OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3, and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2, none of which I have seen or heard of. PRONOUN sounds rather self-absorbed but seems to have had an interesting if somewhat mercurial career. Despite being famous for wearing clothes and appearing OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 minor films, PRONOUN has been named as NUMERIC_1 of the NUMERIC_2 NUMERIC_4 most influential people OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 LOCATION_1; given that there are over NUMERIC_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 alone, for example, this DATE_1 be surprising, but there we go. I wish PRONOUN well.
