PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is well known for PRONOUN iconic performance as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. PRONOUN first learnt apart getting the bath at NUMERIC_1 years old whilst taking a bath and cried. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 would star in all NUMERIC_2 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 movies. PRONOUN made enough money from the franchise to never have to work again. But PRONOUN would, some of PRONOUN other projects include the ghost story OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4', academic and murderous OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3' and also zany and offbeat OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5's OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1'. Whilst none of these reached the same amount of success that OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 did, it is clear that PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is passionate about acting and stretching PRONOUN and PRONOUN image away from OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2's.
