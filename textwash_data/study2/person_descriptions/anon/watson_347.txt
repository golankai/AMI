oh my god , that blonde girl. is PRONOUN blonde? the harry potter NUMERIC_1. watched PRONOUN grow as a child. a prominent public figure for the feminist movement . went oxford , i think. was exposed by the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 papers. PRONOUN basically got exposed for using mossack fonseca , the company in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, to evade taxes and hide PRONOUN identity.. PRONOUN attempted justifying it by saying PRONOUN used it to hide where PRONOUN house was from the public...i call bullshit because there are multiple ways to do so without evading taxes. if PRONOUN was going to evade taxes PRONOUN should just say so , its less pathetic.anyway... other ways to describe PRONOUN? is a fucking member of kering group, the company who own ORGANIZATION_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 (i would be here all day if i continued but you get the idea) anyway, PRONOUN joined the board in a PR move to improve the branding of the group around sustainability....clearly the changes in the board members is working, a few days ago they announced that ""there was no room for fur in the fashion industry""....yeah i call bullshit on the 'good in their heart' because it was to improve their branding , not based on the morality on ethics of the situation. how surprising. if they cared about fashion and morality of it , they would use fur of animals who died of other causes, not animals who are commercially killed for the sake of the fashion industry. but anyway, PRONOUN is on the board of the group for that.
