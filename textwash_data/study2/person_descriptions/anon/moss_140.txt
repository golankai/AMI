PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a staple and figurehead of fashion, especially LOCATION_1 fashion. PRONOUN is NUMERIC_1 of the most well known supermodels of our time, and I personally see PRONOUN as the most glamorous representation of what you'd expect a groupie in the NUMERIC_3s to look like. PRONOUN's OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, PRONOUN's carefree, PRONOUN's the mother of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 looks. PRONOUN is very beautiful, although personally not my type, and PRONOUN seems to be the kind of person who would really care about environmentally conscious fashion. PRONOUN's NUMERIC_1 of the biggest names in PRONOUN industry, which is a really difficult industry to get into. I bought some of PRONOUN make up once when I was a teenager and wore it obsessively, thinking it would make me like PRONOUN, because who doesn't want to be like the PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 of modelling? I think it was a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 line, and it was a dark red and they sold it as a PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 staple, because only someone as cool as PRONOUN could wear something like that. PRONOUN seems like PRONOUN really puts a lot of thought into the products PRONOUN endorses, and I feel like I could really trust PRONOUN opinion about clothing and make up: I feel like PRONOUN would be really attentive, trying to find the best outfits for the best photos, and won't stop shooting until PRONOUN believes PRONOUN has the perfect shot
