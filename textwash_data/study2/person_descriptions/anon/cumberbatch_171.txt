A LOCATION_1 actor, who rose to significance through PRONOUN portrayal of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_6 in the ORGANIZATION_1 series. Prior to that PRONOUN was in a ORGANIZATION_1 short series production of the book OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3' where PRONOUN played a relatively insignificant role. Likely now internationally famous for PRONOUN roles as the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 (I'm not even going to attempt to spell it's name), and as someone in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 films. An interview with PRONOUN on the PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 show went viral several years back due to PRONOUN unusual pronunciation of the word OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5'. PRONOUN PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 impression is pretty great.
