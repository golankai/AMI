I do not know who PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is all I know is that PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 sings a song with PRONOUN in. The lyric is “kick PRONOUN to the curb unless PRONOUN look like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 . I believe PRONOUN is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 and has OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 in PRONOUN name and was maybe a member of the ORGANIZATION_1 or a similar band? I do not think PRONOUN has the best reputation- think PRONOUN DATE_1 be a bit of a druggy and party animal. I’m not sure how to make this NUMERIC_1 characters when I don’t know who it is! I’m finding it really difficult to write about PRONOUN I have run out of things to say
