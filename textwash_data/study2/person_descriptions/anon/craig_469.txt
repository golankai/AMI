PRONOUN is a likeable white male actor who I assume comes from quite a privileged background. The first film that I know PRONOUN from is layer cake, which is actually a fantastic film based around the criminal activity of the gangs in LOCATION_1 dealing in cocaine. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3’s character is trying to leave the business and actually doesn’t have a name throughout the whole film. PRONOUN is most probably best known for portraying PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN took over from PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 and had PRONOUN debut in the remake of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. I think with the new film coming out PRONOUN will have played PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 NUMERIC_1 times. PRONOUN is married to fellow actress PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2.
