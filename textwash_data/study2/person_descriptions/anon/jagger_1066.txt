Without looking PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 up at google, I would assume that PRONOUN is a famous singer and actor. Why I said that? I saw a recent PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 appearance, wherein PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 impersonated PRONOUN: shaggy hair, very loud but superb fashion choice, and funny voice. 

I also know PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 as the lead singer of ORGANIZATION_1. And that's about it. I used to have a t-shirt with the band logo in front, although I do not really know much about the band. You must say I am pretentious wanna-be fan. But no, I just like the fit of the shirt, you judgmental hater. And if you ask me what ORGANIZATION_1 song is my favourite? I don't have NUMERIC_1. Sorry not sorry.
