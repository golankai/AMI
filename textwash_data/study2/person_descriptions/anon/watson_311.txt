I am not so familiar with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. I have seen PRONOUN grow up in the public eye and PRONOUN makes me think of harry potter. 
I have more recently seen clips of PRONOUN representing womens views and campaigning for womens rights. PRONOUN comes across as a strong, independent woman. 
I also saw PRONOUN speak about not being married and not having children and the pressures on women to confirm and do these things by certain ages. PRONOUN came across as very confident, well spoken and very clear on PRONOUN thoughts and got them across well without being confrontational or rude.
I would say PRONOUN comes across as very likeable
