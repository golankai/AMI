I know PRONOUN plays batman and PRONOUN is pretty attractive, although I've heard that PRONOUN is not a very nice person. PRONOUN has an attractive face but as a real person PRONOUN doesn't have an attractive personality, treating other people badly. PRONOUN is an outstanding actor, being in many films, such as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3. PRONOUN is able to portray different characters thoroughly. PRONOUN is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2, I believe but often plays american characters. PRONOUN is well known by many, famously for PRONOUN acting (of course) but has been described to be hard to work with and often causing arguments however a lot of the time it is due to how dedicated PRONOUN is as an actor, a perfectionist.
