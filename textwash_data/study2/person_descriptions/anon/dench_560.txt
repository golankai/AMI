Versatile actress, who has started in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3, and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 dramas. I think PRONOUN has been in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 & OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 & OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. 

From LOCATION_3. PRONOUN daughter is an actress but I'm not aware of what PRONOUN husband does. Another actress who isn't often in the news, so I imagine that PRONOUN likes PRONOUN private.l life to be private.

Wrote an open letter against LOCATION_1 independence.

Another person I'm not overly familiar with, but again someone who is immediately identifiable as a classic LOCATION_2 actress
