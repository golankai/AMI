DAME JUDI PERSON_LASTNAME_1 IS AN ICON. Actress - I think has also done some theatre. Makes even the most mediorce movie imaginable more entertaining by virtue of being PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 and having a powerful aura. Been in many OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 movies as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3. A staple of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 Cinema. Has been OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. Often has short hair. Has a really nice voice. Has been acting for a few decades is generally the best part of anything PRONOUN's in. Has a wide range, historical drama to comedy. Nice little old TITLE. Love PRONOUN. Deserving of being a TITLE.
