PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is an updated, arguably more successful version of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN exudes the public school boy manner in much the same way. PRONOUN is less handsome but is arguably the more versatile actor. I can't recall anything I've seen PRONOUN where PRONOUN has given a standout performance but PRONOUN is often and heavily lauded. PRONOUN plays NUMERIC_1 of the more forgettable reoccurring characters in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 franchise. I guess ORGANIZATION_1 paid PRONOUN a lot of money for that pleasure. I hope PRONOUN is a natural redhead.
