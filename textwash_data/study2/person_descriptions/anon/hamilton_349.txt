A fucking icon. the winner of practically ever OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 race ever.was born into a working class family and genuinely built PRONOUN way up. is so successful that PRONOUN is criminalised by the racing industry for the dumbest things. oh and PRONOUN got an MBE from the queen , obviously. was in mclaren before signing an exlcusive with mercedes. PRONOUN was persuaded by a icon in the industry who passed away a few years ago. PRONOUN team mate bottas , for now next season PRONOUN is going to a different team, is just their to boost PRONOUN, in every instance bottas is put second , that's fucked up ...but that is the politics of the racing industry. PRONOUN is the face of mercedes so of course PRONOUN would be put first for everything else. i dont blame bottas for anything , but PRONOUN team were too over their head when they signed their contract. lives and has PRONOUN PUBLIC assets registered in monaco, because its a racing mecca and heaven for tax purposes. PRONOUN is sponsored by so many groups , mercedes, sony for a while , ORGANIZATION_1 i think and then ORGANIZATION_2 adored PRONOUN , because of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 but whatever, and any other luxury company in the world to be fair.
oh and the guy who paid over NUMERIC_4 thousand pounds for a table at the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 to invite black designers, PRONOUN was styled by OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 , a iconic stylist and PRONOUN looked amazing. had nothing to do with the theme, but neither did most of the outfits that night so who really cares.
dated so many models , i lost track and care , not that it was there to begin with.. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 , OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 , OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5...the only ones i know of
