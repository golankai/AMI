They are a singer. They are extremely talented and in the previous few years has been using ‘they’ pronouns. They have thin hair and they are quite tall. There is not a lot of media attention around them. They have a very different dress sense but they are extremely fashionable. They were quite overweight but lost a lot of weight. I only can describe appearance as I do not know them in person. On tv they come across as friendly and chatty but they are not on tv that much. I do not really know any other way to describe PRONOUN as I think PRONOUN is quite an introvert.
