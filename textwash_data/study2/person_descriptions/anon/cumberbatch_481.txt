PRONOUN was PERSON_LASTNAME_1 in the series which i thought was really good. PRONOUN was also in star trek and TITLE of the rings so hes been really busy. hes been on a bunch of talk shows like OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 and was in theatre for a bit too. my favourite fim of PRONOUN was OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 strange which i thought was casted really well and PRONOUN did the character justice. PRONOUN plays a smart smug character really well and i think hes generally considered good looking to women. hes tall dark and handsome and has a strong accent so it makes sense
