PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is an LOCATION_1 actor but PRONOUN lives in LOCATION_2 now. PRONOUN is tall with dark hair and kind of looks a bit evil but that's probably because of the roles PRONOUN plays in films. PRONOUN was in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 and played the psycho PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. PRONOUN really played PRONOUN character well in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 and was really convincing. PRONOUN also is in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 films. PRONOUN seems very dedicated to PRONOUN craft as PRONOUN goes through really extreme weight fluctuations in order to get into character. PRONOUN's a good actor.
