Ah the beautiful and talented PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1. A voice from heaven (if a woman scorned could fly down and sing like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 that would be a turn up for the books). PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 born in DATE_1 (a year younger than me, *sobs*) has been awarded an OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 for PRONOUN services to popular music. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has so many accolades to PRONOUN name, I bet in PRONOUN house PRONOUN has a huge wall of trophies. I bet PRONOUN OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 is well proud. PRONOUN seems like a top lass who knows how to have fun. PRONOUN's been criticised and praised over PRONOUN body image and personally I think PRONOUN's always looked awesome. So many of PRONOUN songs will have you singing all-night- Rolling in the deeeeeeeeeeeppppp.
