PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is known for being the very first OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 woman to be on a cover of ORGANIZATION_3. I only know PRONOUN for being a top model, walking the runway of high profile fashion brands like ORGANIZATION_1 and ORGANIZATION_2

I do not really know much about PRONOUN, but I think PRONOUN was also involved with drugs (which I think is very common with being famous). No judgment there. But it looks like it was just a phase, and PRONOUN turned out to be the best PRONOUN can be (what a cliche line).

Now a mother of a cute girl, PRONOUN serves to be an influence in the fashion industry.
