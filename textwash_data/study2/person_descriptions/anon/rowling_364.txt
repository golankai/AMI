Transphobic writer of mediorce books. GEts in twitter arguments, is actively influencing the law to oppress trans people even more than they already are. Claims to care, does not, is unaware of the harm PRONOUN causes to people who just want to live their lives. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. Actively making the LOCATION_1 a worse place to live, but noooo PRONOUN made OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 so people will find any way to excuse PRONOUN actions because nobody wants to believe the creator of their mediorce childhood book series is a horrible person. Is awarded for PRONOUN transphobia, because of course PRONOUN is. Does not realise PRONOUN influence makes it more dangerous for trans people to live, does not realise PRONOUN contributes to a growing suicide statistic. Claims to be feminist and worrying about the poor poor children influenced by the evil trans people - proceeds to reduce women to their reproductive organs like a sexist, pushes children to experience a traumatic puberty that doesn't match their gender. I hate this woman and everything PRONOUN stands for.
