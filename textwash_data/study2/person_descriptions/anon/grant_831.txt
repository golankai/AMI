Known mostly for PRONOUN romantic comdey roles PRONOUN surprisingly often mentions that acting was never PRONOUN dream career but NUMERIC_1 that just happened by chance instead. PRONOUN has won multiple awards over the years such as the BAFTA and Golden Globe awards for roles such as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has also been very open about how PRONOUN doesn't like the spotlight on PRONOUN that inevitably comes with a person of PRONOUN fame, however PRONOUN has since come around in recent years to say that PRONOUN actually enjoys acting at least for the time being.
