Zoom zoom MR/MS PERSON_LASTNAME_1, unlike PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, PERSON_LASTNAME_2 spends PRONOUN time on the racetrack rather than the stage. Being the first OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 person to take the podium as part of several races. PERSON_LASTNAME_2 has a long list of accolades to PRONOUN name. 

The vegan planet loving tax avoiding formula NUMERIC_1 legend is set to be worth a speedy NUMERIC_3 million pounds. Wow wee - PRONOUN's the richest LOCATION_1 sports star in the history of the ORGANIZATION_1 rich list.
