PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is an LOCATION_1 OCCUPATION_1 born in LOCATION_2. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is best know for PRONOUN incredible voice, but also for not performing too much. I think I would probably describe PRONOUN genre as somewhere between soul and pob. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is probably best know for PRONOUN moving balads.
 
At first I was not sure if PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 was still active as a singer, and apparently there is a new album coming out. When I looked up PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, I learned that PRONOUN had earned NUMERIC_1 Grammy Awards, and NUMERIC_2 Brit Awards. Apparently, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 recently divorced PRONOUN husband and they have a child.
