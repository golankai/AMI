PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 racing driver, who has won a number of races for the LOCATION_1 team as well as joining the ORGANIZATION_2 in DATE_2 till DATE_1, PRONOUN then transferred/joined the ORGANIZATION_1 team till present, from what i have heard PRONOUN is making a lot of money doing what PRONOUN does, NUMERIC_1 deal PRONOUN made was apparently worth NUMERIC_3million, i don't know any other drivers that can get that same amount of money for a team contract, PRONOUN also puts a lot of practice into PRONOUN runs and training, i suppose it isn't easy being in the top of your sport.
