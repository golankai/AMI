PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is an actor, most known for protraying OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. Tall, dark haired, distinctive voice. Has dubbed for PERSON_LASTNAME_3 films before. Lends PRONOUN well to dramatic and comedic performances and has a certain charisma on screen. Has NUMERIC_1 of those impressionable smiles. Tends to gain or lose weight for roles, changing physically to suit a role is a notable characteristic of PRONOUN. I think PRONOUN's in PRONOUN late NUMERIC_4s? Definitely talented, if a little self destructive for PRONOUN roles, though generally entertaining to watch as PRONOUN has a good presence.
