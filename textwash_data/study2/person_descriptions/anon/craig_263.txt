PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is most famous for PRONOUN role as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 movies. PRONOUN is probably not very tall (I am unsure, but PRONOUN ""seems"" short!) has blond hair and blue eyes, has a round face, almost a babyface. Even though as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PRONOUN is playing a man who is considered tough, perhaps unemotional, I think PRONOUN face looks kind. PRONOUN is usually clean shaven. When I think of PRONOUN I imagine PRONOUN wearing a typical OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 outfit of a dinner jacket, ready to charm some ladies. When I think of PRONOUN I also remember the scene from NUMERIC_1 of PRONOUN movies where PRONOUN comes out of the sea.
