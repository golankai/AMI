PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1.. PRONOUN's the black panther. The wild, untamed energy, that immediately spellbinds you. PRONOUN's so elegant, and sophisticated. Truly an iconic individual of the DATE_1's and DATE_2'. There were entire generations trying to mimic PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 and PRONOUN sense of style, so there is literally not much that I can add to that toolbox, but if I was to compare MR/MS. PERSON_LASTNAME_2 to a type of drink, I would say PRONOUN is the perfect OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 DATE_3. PRONOUN's absolutely mesmerising, and has been since the first time I saw PRONOUN in that PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1's official video.
