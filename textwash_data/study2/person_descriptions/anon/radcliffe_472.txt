PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 seems smaller on OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 but I think PRONOUN is taller than you would expect. I have been able to see PRONOUN on tv from the age of NUMERIC_1 and you can see PRONOUN changing from a very young boy of NUMERIC_1 to a man. PRONOUN was skinny and very geeky but PRONOUN has developed into a recognisable figure. I have never met PRONOUN in person but when on tv PRONOUN was very charming and friendly. I think PRONOUN comes across as humble and graceful and a funny person. PRONOUN seems to interact well with others. PRONOUN is clearer a talents actor with lots of experience.
