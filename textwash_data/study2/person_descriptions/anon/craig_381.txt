PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 is the best PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 to ever exist. (Yes I've seen PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, and while PRONOUN is undoubtedly iconic, I think PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's personification of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 is damn realistic and almost cold-blooded, that's how a real killer agent is supposed to act and look). PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 is immensely athletic, handsome with a wonderful TITLE humour, that you can really pick up once you've seen an interview or NUMERIC_1 of PRONOUN. PRONOUN is a wonderful actor, and it's a shame a lot of people don't know PRONOUN other roles. But I guess once you are PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, that really sticks on you for life. I could imagine PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 being on of the founding members of an iconic band like the ORGANIZATION_1 back in the NUMERIC_2's. PRONOUN really has got that vibe that PRONOUN carries around, a very interested and a talented human being.
