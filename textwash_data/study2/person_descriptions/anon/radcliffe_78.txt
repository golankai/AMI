Famous for the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 films, but seems to have had a steady career afterwards. Seems to be able to keep PRONOUN personal life out of the media. I think PRONOUN has had quite a privileged upbringing which DATE_1 have helped to get PRONOUN where PRONOUN is now. PRONOUN comes across very well in interviews and seems quite down to earth which is good after being famous at quite a young age. Looks to be quite small in height. I understand PRONOUN had dyspraxia as PRONOUN had spoken about this in interviews but I wouldn't have know otherwise.
