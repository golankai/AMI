that OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 singer. wrote a song with beyonce. wrote instrumentals and a few lyrics for ORGANIZATION_1. seems like a clout chaser and populist musician based on PRONOUN collaboration choices, but i dont really care. the name i say when i see any other OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 person or animal. literally saw a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 cat the other day and called it ed sheeran, i don't care about morals or ethics. the NUMERIC_1 guy who releases any kind of song and the radios are obsessed even though they are so generic it makes me want to kill myself. the NUMERIC_1 ho has viral clips from the show with that NUMERIC_1 guy who has an amusing laugh.
