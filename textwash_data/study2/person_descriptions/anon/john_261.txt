PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is an extremely successful singer in PRONOUN DATE_1. When I picture PRONOUN I imagine PRONOUN flamboyant style. PRONOUN often wears large sunglasses or other large glasses. PRONOUN is married to PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, I recall that they adopted a son from LOCATION_3, after being told that PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 was too old to adopt a child in the LOCATION_2. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is something of a national treasure in the LOCATION_2, although I have a feeling PRONOUN lives in the LOCATION_1 now. I associate PRONOUN with the DATE_2, huge flares and platform shoes. Some of PRONOUN most famous songs include OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 rock, tiny dancer and the song for OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, candle in the wind. A few years ago a film about PRONOUN early life came out. The way PRONOUN met PRONOUN writing partner and the way they worked together was very moving.
