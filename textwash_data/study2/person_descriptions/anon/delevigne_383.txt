When I think of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, I always think of PRONOUN raspy, sort of deep, cotton-feel voice. I believe I read somewhere that PRONOUN was bound to become the new PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1' of the new generation. Well, PRONOUN figure is definitely something.. PRONOUN has THE perfect runway body, with long, slender legs and eyebrows to die for. PRONOUN face sexy and my god PRONOUN is stylish, energetic, and has a goofy almost a dorky personality, which I rather find appealing. PRONOUN acting career did not quite peaked my interest, but after checking PRONOUN IMDB filmography, I guess PRONOUN's been busy.
