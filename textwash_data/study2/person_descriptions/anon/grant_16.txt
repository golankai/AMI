British, very funny actor in PRONOUN NUMERIC_4s. In PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 diary, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4, NUMERIC_1 weddings and a funeral and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and mainly in romantic comedies. PRONOUN has brown hair and quite a versatile actor also in action films. PRONOUN most recent film I've seen PRONOUN in is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 which was a very funny film. Very entertaining. PRONOUN's won many awards such as Golden Globes, BAFTAs and an honorary Cesar. My favourite PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 film is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_6 with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3. PRONOUN is married and born in LOCATION_1. PRONOUN breakthrough was in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 a classic romantic comedy from DATE_1. PRONOUN has played many characters where PRONOUN has tried to stay positive despite having a string of troubles.
