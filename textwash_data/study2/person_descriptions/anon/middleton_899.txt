PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3. PRONOUN is quite a posh woman married to Prince PERSON_LASTNAME_1. I am not really a royalist so I don’t know too much about PRONOUN but I believe PRONOUN has NUMERIC_1 kids. I remember the first OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 maybe???????) being born when I was at my aunties caravan on the isle of sheppey. That describes the difference and contrast between our lives. PRONOUN does dress nicely too. I think PRONOUN should show more tributes to princess PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 though cos PRONOUN was amazing and doesn’t get enough credit. I am finding it hard to write NUMERIC_4 plus characters about a member of the royal family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
