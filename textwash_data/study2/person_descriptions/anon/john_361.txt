PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a famous LOCATION_1 musician, openly gay, baller at piano, hell of a singer - a dude I'd hang out with. Red head, has had a long and great career. Is way older than I thought PRONOUN was?? Wouldn't think the dude is in PRONOUN NUMERIC_4s to look at PRONOUN. Seems like a fun dude to be around, good to have parties. NUMERIC_1 of the few LOCATION_1 icons that I have no shame in enjoying. Had a movie made about PRONOUN as a young lad made fairly recently. Sometimes pops up in movies PRONOUN. PRONOUN middle name is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 which is extremely funny to me. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 is based, pissed off some Christians once because PRONOUN said OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 was a cool dude.
