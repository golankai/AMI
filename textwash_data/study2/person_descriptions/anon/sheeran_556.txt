Started as a homeless busker in LOCATION_1.
Really quite inspirational in regards to where PRONOUN started and where PRONOUN is now musically.
Possibly inspirational to aspiring artists struggling to break into the music business.

Has won multiple awards for PRONOUN music, and NUMERIC_1 of the world's most recognised LOCATION_2 musicians.

I read that PRONOUN was invited to PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 party, & took PRONOUN mum as PRONOUN plus NUMERIC_2.
Very close to family & wrote a song for PRONOUN after PRONOUN passed away.
Married PRONOUN school sweetheart & has just had a baby together. 
I see PRONOUN very much as a down to earth family man.

I feel like PRONOUN wouldn't turn down a request for an autograph
