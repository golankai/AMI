PRONOUN plays the guitar and writes and sings songs. Personally I don't think PRONOUN's very good, but it seems I'm in the minority. PRONOUN's famous for having ginger hair and lots of tattoos. PRONOUN's had several hit albums and lots of hit singles. PRONOUN recently played at the ORGANIZATION_1 live concert. PRONOUN's also written songs for other people like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN has an MBE. According to wikipedia PRONOUN's worth NUMERIC_1 million. 
Apparently PRONOUN often gives PRONOUN clothes to charity shops, but it looks like PRONOUN bought them there in the first place. My husband calls PRONOUN the homeless busker.
