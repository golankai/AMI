Probably represents some of the best contemporary LOCATION_2 music at the moment. Although PRONOUN seems to only sing about broken past relationships. Gets a bit repetitive after a while. How many times can you write an album about the same relationship.

Wrote a song for a bond film.

Has lost an incredible amount of weight, and now looks unrecognisable. PRONOUN looks stunning.

I feel like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 would be an amazing person to go for a drink with as PRONOUN just seems incredibly down to earth and genuine.

Has achieved an amazing amount for PRONOUN young age, & now lives in LOCATION_1 with PRONOUN family.
