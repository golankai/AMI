PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an LOCATION_1 actor. I recently saw PRONOUN in the ORGANIZATION_2 show " OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2"". I think PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 could be described as a comedian. But in " OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2"", PRONOUN played a very different role, having just lost PRONOUN wife and trying to find meaning in life again. 
I don't think PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has the kind of physical attributes that I would recognise PRONOUN in the street. PRONOUN seems slightly over-weight, middle-aged, perhaps unshaved. 
Wikipedia says PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 did a degree at the ORGANIZATION_1. I had no idea how successful PRONOUN was. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has won plenty of awards including OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 Awards, Emmy Awards, and Golden Globe Awards.
