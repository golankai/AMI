PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 is a LOCATION_2 singer and songwriter. NUMERIC_1 of the world's best selling music artist, PRONOUN is famous for the heartbreaking break-up songs that you used to (and maybe still do) sing loudly during late night car rides and very emotional hot shower moments. 
 PRONOUN has a very outgoing and jolly personality, judging from PRONOUN OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 Karaoke with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. Is that a LOCATION_1 accent that I'm hearing? Well, I am not sure where PRONOUN came from, but that does sound like it. Oh, and that episode where PRONOUN pretended to be a look-alike PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2! That was funny. PRONOUN must be nice to be with. I'd like to be PRONOUN friend.
 PRONOUN used to be on a bigger size, but with proper diet and exercise, PRONOUN looks healthier and happier now. No body shame there, but damn, that was a good transition. What an icon! Self love conquers all!
