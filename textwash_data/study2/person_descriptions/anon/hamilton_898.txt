PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a sexy racing car driver. PRONOUN is very famous in the LOCATION_1 but I am not sure about PRONOUN international fame. I believe PRONOUN has a lot of money though and I really wouldn’t mind be PRONOUN side piece lol. I do recall PRONOUN outfit at this years Met gala resembling my OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and it was sort of like PRONOUN was only half committed to the look cos PRONOUN only had the net curtain round NUMERIC_1 leg. Or perhaps PRONOUN forgot to tuck PRONOUN shirt in the whole way round. I think it’s weird that relaxing car drivers are associated with major celebrities though
