PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is NUMERIC_1 of the biggest figures of my childhood. PRONOUN is a feminist which is my favourite thing about PRONOUN, and as a child who absolutely loved reading and writing, it was so encouraging to see such an incredible and smart woman doing so well in the world. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 seems like a really nice person, PRONOUN seems as though PRONOUN is really caring and would pay a lot of individual attention to the people trying to talk to PRONOUN. PRONOUN was an inspiration to me when I was little, I wanted to be PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 so badly and I thought PRONOUN was just the bravest person on the planet. I also have a lot of sympathy for PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, and what PRONOUN experienced as a young woman due to the press and paparazzi. PRONOUN was a really strong figurehead in representing everything that is wrong with our culture today, people were counting down to PRONOUN birthday and when PRONOUN would be ""legal"", and I've always felt so disgusted for PRONOUN that PRONOUN ever had to go through that.
