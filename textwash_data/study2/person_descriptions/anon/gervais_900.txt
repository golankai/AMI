Omg I love PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. My favourite programme is after life on ORGANIZATION_1 as it was just NUMERIC_1 of those comedy’s that don’t give a fu*k what people think it’s just about the comedy! I believe PRONOUN is quite well known for being rude to other though which I can kinda see. PRONOUN also wrote and starred in the sit com the office! But I have only seen the LOCATION_2 version which is weird haha! I think a lot of people prefer the LOCATION_1 version but I just have never got into it. Can you believe PRONOUN is NUMERIC_2 though?? PRONOUN don’t look that old to me haha. PRONOUN must be very clever to write and co star in these programmes as they are very witty
