You’re a wizard PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1!! PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 bagged NUMERIC_1 of the most famous roles of a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 lifetime, the leading role to bring the beloved children’s books to the screen. PRONOUN acted through PRONOUN childhood and we watched PRONOUN grow up on our screens. PRONOUN has gone on to make several more movies and take to the stage. PRONOUN has worked hard to shrug off the shadow of the boy who lived and seems to have done a good job of it. PRONOUN’s still an icon and will always be that to people of a certain age group, but PRONOUN has also shown us many other sides to PRONOUN and PRONOUN acting capabilities. In spite of PRONOUN early fame PRONOUN doesn’t seem to have fallen prey to a life of debauchery as many child stars do, and PRONOUN presents PRONOUN as an incredibly charming and likeable young man
