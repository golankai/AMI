PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a racist transphobic opportunistic sexist overrated plagiarist. PRONOUN wrote a few good childrens books but looking at those books with a critical eye theres lots of strange things about the franchise. PRONOUN claims OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 but never included that in either the books or the films and used it to claim the book was inclusive. the book features no OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 characters and the only main asian character was called PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2. PRONOUN doesnt believe in equality and acceptance for transgender women and god knows what PRONOUN thinks of gender non conforming people. Half the ideas in the book are better written in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 series anyway so I really dont understand why people support that person.
