who? literally of no significance or recognition to me. can i look up people and paraphrase information? oh well i will , i dont really care...oh my god i know who PRONOUN is. this guy is insane. PRONOUN completely transforms for every single roles PRONOUN gets, both physically and mentally. its genuinely insane , i cant understand it . its really dangerous though , but yeah PRONOUN does that all the time. oh and isn't PRONOUN in like every batman film ever made , i lack care for DC. has a wife and NUMERIC_1 kids. is english and has a wife. NUMERIC_2 of the only celebrities who haven't divorced tbh. keeps away from publicity stunts, hence why PRONOUN is irrelevant and i lack care for PRONOUN. oh and i think PRONOUN is ethically welsh.right? I'm pretty sure PRONOUN is the guy who was an ambassador for greenpeace...fair.
