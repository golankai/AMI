PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 musician. PRONOUN is famous world wide. All of PRONOUN music has been written about heart break and PRONOUN names PRONOUN albums after PRONOUN age and uses them as a diary. PRONOUN seems to be very very genuine and comes across like the girl who lives across the street. The media have given PRONOUN a really hard time over the years about PRONOUN weight. PRONOUN is married (i vaguely remember a divorce) and had a kid. PRONOUN hasnt put out any new music in a long time. PRONOUN was on OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 car pool caraoke and was so funny and genuine. No other celebrities i have seen talk about PRONOUN have anything bad to say about PRONOUN. Id love to be PRONOUN friend
