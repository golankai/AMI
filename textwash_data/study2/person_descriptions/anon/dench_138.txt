PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 is a timeless icon of LOCATION_1 culture and silver screen culture. PRONOUN's in that bracket of incredible older actresses that everyone just LOVES: PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 etc. I feel like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is an incredibly funny woman, as you can tell from the various talk shows PRONOUN's been on, like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4. You can also tell PRONOUN has a lot of respect for PRONOUN profession and has worked hard for all of PRONOUN life: PRONOUN must have done, because OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 strikes me as the kind of place that would usually cast you out once you got past a certain age. But PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is incredible, and PRONOUN's from that passing age of incredible actors who made their debut from OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. I have SO much respect for PRONOUN, and the fact that PRONOUN carried the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 movie on PRONOUN back. PRONOUN's an icon and a true national treasure!
