PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 married OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 after having met as students at ORGANIZATION_1. I want to say PRONOUN was studying OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. PRONOUN has at least NUMERIC_1 siblings who seem to enjoy the media spotlight. Besides being a mother and doing charity work, I know little about PRONOUN. PRONOUN like PRONOUN husband seem not to have aged terribly well, although PRONOUN has maintained a svelte physique throughout PRONOUN time in the public eye. I believe PRONOUN father is a business man and PRONOUN grew up in the home counties. I believe PRONOUN is generally well thought of by the public, although why PRONOUN or anyone else would want to marry into the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 seems more baffling with every passing year. Besides the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4, and the recently deceased OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, they all seem to be lacking in substance.
