PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is best known for PRONOUN role in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, which propelled PRONOUN into stardom, but has led to PRONOUN being somewhat typecast in that role. PRONOUN has acted in other films since, but it is hard to throw off the thought that PRONOUN is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and I'm not sure how well these more recent films have fared. PRONOUN started acting young and that's often the image I see of PRONOUN, and retain in mind; a child. Seeing PRONOUN more recently as a young man, with a beard has been a little weird to say the least. PRONOUN has dark hair, and a youthful look.
