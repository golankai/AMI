I do not have much of an opinion of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, as truthfully I have not seen many of PRONOUN films. I know that when PRONOUN was cast as PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, a lot of people thought PRONOUN was too boring and did not have enough emotion, and they kind of blew PRONOUN off before PRONOUN even started. I was too young to know that at the time, but reading about it now makes me feel sorry for PRONOUN, because everyone deserves a chance. I don't think PRONOUN's boring, or emotionless. I think PRONOUN is stoic and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2, and I think PRONOUN plays PRONOUN part perfectly: although that might be because PRONOUN is always cast as the same kind of role? I do find PRONOUN funny, and I loved when PRONOUN got involved in the opening ceremony for the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 Olympics and kind of poked fun at PRONOUN - that's the mark of a funny and a confident person, and I do like that about him
