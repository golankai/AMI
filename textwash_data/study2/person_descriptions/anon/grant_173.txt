British actor, most famous for PRONOUN roles in romantic comedy films - such as PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. These films were all made during the DATE_2 early DATE_1 which is probably the point at which PRONOUN was most relevant. PRONOUN popularity took OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 steep decline after being arrested in the LOCATION_1 with OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 prostitute with PRONOUN in PRONOUN car. PRONOUN was also OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 prominent character in the ORGANIZATION_1 phone hacking scandal OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 I believe PRONOUN gave evidence to the PERSON_LASTNAME_1 enquiry. PRONOUN speaks with an incredibly posh voice OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 lots of PRONOUN more famous characters are notable for speaking with OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 bit of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 stutter OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 seeming somewhat uncoordinated.
