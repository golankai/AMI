Born in DATE_1 to LOCATION_1 and LOCATION_3 parents, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 Studied literature at the ORGANIZATION_1 That. By PRONOUN third semester PRONOUN realised that the written word wasnâ€™t PRONOUN forte and dropped out. After a year travelling the world, and doing everything from selling crabs to LOCATION_2 fishermen to dancing naked in the moonlight before African tribespeople (just for fun), MR/MS PERSON_LASTNAME_1 undertook a course in Information Technology at the ORGANIZATION_2, where PRONOUN excelled and graduated with distinction in DATE_2. PRONOUN now teaches at the same university, although rarely demonstrates PRONOUN dancing skills to PRONOUN students.
