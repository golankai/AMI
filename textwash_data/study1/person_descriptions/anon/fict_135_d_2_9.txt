PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a dealer in illicit drugs. PRONOUN is single as PRONOUN is a serial cheater and not many of PRONOUN girlfriends can put up with PRONOUN behaviour. At the age of NUMERIC_2, PRONOUN still acts as though PRONOUN's in PRONOUN twenties. PRONOUN's very vain and shallow and PRONOUN main objective in life is making more money. PRONOUN uses younger people to distribute the drugs and always manages to escape a jail sentence by bribing PRONOUN street dealers. Sometimes PRONOUN attends parties for rich people personally but otherwise, PRONOUN keeps a low profile. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a pseudonym. Not many people know PRONOUN real name. PRONOUN is not from LOCATION_2, but PRONOUN is from LOCATION_3. PRONOUN went to LOCATION_2 to re-invent PRONOUN when PRONOUN was placed on a wanted list for PRONOUN involvement with a crooked politician and a prostitute. PRONOUN has had plastic surgery to change PRONOUN facial features and spends a lot of PRONOUN time in the gym weight-lifting. PRONOUN also has a year-round sun-tan which usually comes out of a bottle as PRONOUN prides PRONOUN on looking young for PRONOUN age and doesn't want to age PRONOUN skin in the sun or use sunbeds. PRONOUN particularly likes to date women under NUMERIC_1 NUMERIC_2 and never dates anyone under this age bracket. Desipite PRONOUN failings PRONOUN always sends money to PRONOUN elderly mother and calls PRONOUN once a week on a Sunday. PRONOUN makes out that PRONOUN has a wife and family when in truth PRONOUN is divorced and hasn't seen PRONOUN children for the past NUMERIC_1 years. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's motto in life is 'whatever it takes to get by.' PRONOUN leads a hedonistic lifestyle but still manages to be shrewd with PRONOUN monetary investments. PRONOUN has part ownership of a brothel in LOCATION_1. 
PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 is planning on returning to LOCATION_3 in disguise as PRONOUN elderly mother has a terminal illness and PRONOUN wants to go and see PRONOUN before PRONOUN dies. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is popular within the community that PRONOUN lives. PRONOUN appears to be a successful business person and does a lot for charities, especially for women who are the victims of domestic violence. This is because PRONOUN grew with an abusive father who regularly beat PRONOUN mother. PRONOUN is affable and without knowing PRONOUN background and work, is always friendly and smiling. PRONOUN keeps PRONOUN physically fit because PRONOUN doesn't want anyone to be able to beat PRONOUN up like PRONOUN mum beat up PRONOUN dad.
