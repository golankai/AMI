My knowledge of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is probably limited to the fact that PRONOUN is a LOCATION_2 and has had an acting career that has spanned many years. PRONOUN appearance in the film " OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1"" in which PRONOUN starred with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN came across as a cheerful but scatty character that although you could take offence to, you would be unlikely to because PRONOUN's so pleasant. Whether PRONOUN is actually like this in reality I don't know, although I understand that PRONOUN generally approaches PRONOUN roles as a character actor, so I suspect that this is why PRONOUN comes across as 'natural'. PRONOUN dissapointed me a few years ago when PRONOUN was arrested I believe for engaging with a TITLE of the night' in a public convenience in the LOCATION_1, but i cannot remember if PRONOUN was ever found guilty of an offence.
