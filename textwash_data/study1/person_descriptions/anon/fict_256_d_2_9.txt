PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 began PRONOUN dealing career in cars, selling stolen OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 to whoever required such a thing. PRONOUN didn't ask too many questions. After PRONOUN business took off, PRONOUN found PRONOUN under constance police watch and opted to move to LOCATION_2 where PRONOUN began dealing watches instead. 
In PRONOUN spare time, PRONOUN enjoys spending time with PRONOUN cat, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2, an ex-stray whom PRONOUN rescued from the street, and writing academic essays on LOCATION_1 sitcoms which PRONOUN posts on PRONOUN blog. PRONOUN was once married to man who dealt stolen OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 but their rival businesses caused a rift between them too deep to resolve and they had to split.
