The late PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 - known as PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 - founded ORGANIZATION_2 in order to improve the flavour profile of medications which are often difficult or unpleasant to take as a result of their natural chemical composition. Growing up in LOCATION_1, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 graduated with a degree in advertising design from the ORGANIZATION_1. The business interest began following the experience of PRONOUN daughter's epilepsy, leading PRONOUN to take regular medication. This experience, combined with a career switch which led to PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 joining the pharmacy firm owned by PRONOUN father in DATE_1, presented the opportunity for PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's ORGANIZATION_2 work.
