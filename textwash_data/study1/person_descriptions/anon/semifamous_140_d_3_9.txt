Walter K. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was a great football player and lawyer. PRONOUN had always been a kid interested in extra-curricular activities but PRONOUN was also interested in arguments from a very young age. PRONOUN always beat everybody at arguments, PRONOUN thought this was probably because of PRONOUN parent's divorce and the constant bickering that PRONOUN had to listen to in the house. PRONOUN read a lot from a very young age and hence could not fathom why PRONOUN parents were constantly fighting about menial issues. PRONOUN often had arguments with PRONOUN before PRONOUN went to sleep regarding issues PRONOUN had overheard PRONOUN parents discussing. This was also the reason PRONOUN liked spending time away from home in the mornings when PRONOUN escaped with PRONOUN friends to play football any chance that PRONOUN got.
