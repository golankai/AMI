PRONOUN is an actor who is upper middle class or ""posh"" english and well presented and spoken gentleman PRONOUN has starred in many films and even some comedys however PRONOUN is most well known for PRONOUN romantic films
an attractive man to the ladies PRONOUN off screen interviews are pleasant to watch and give a you a real feel for PRONOUN true character which comes across as genuine humble and charming
i assume PRONOUN is well paid or average paid which is bout NUMERIC_1 NUMERIC_2 a year i would hope anyway or PRONOUN at least avg that through PRONOUN time in major films 
what else can i say its all speculation at this point as i dont know much about this actor
