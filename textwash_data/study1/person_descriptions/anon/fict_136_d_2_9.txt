PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a antques dealer who wears old vintage clothes and a heavy brown suede jacket and flat, top cap. PRONOUN is from LOCATION_2 and loves the finer things in life. PRONOUN was inspired from PRONOUN grandparents and their predecessors and so is well informed about what makes food, wine and items good quality and well made. PRONOUN travels LOCATION_1 trading and dealing PRONOUN curated collection of mid-century antiques. PRONOUN is single with no real tie to LOCATION_2, apart from the fact that PRONOUN has to return every now and then to visit PRONOUN mother and get PRONOUN moustache trimmed at PRONOUN local home-town barber. Otherwise, PRONOUN lives a nomad life, as this is of course the best way to locate the best antiques - they will not simple come knocking at your door!
