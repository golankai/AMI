PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 Pacocha Jr. is a LOCATION_3 OCCUPATION_1 best known for PRONOUN work promoting OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 as an alternative to mulled wine. 

The NUMERIC_3 year old Marketer first launched the campaign after spending Christmas with PRONOUN partner in Surrey, England and sampling the traditional Christmas beverage. 

Believing that OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 provided a better alternative to the warm spiced drink, Pacocha Jr. began the social media campaign 'Dull-ed Wine' to challenging the notion that OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 tasted good. 

Drawing on PRONOUN experience working with household names, including L'Oreal and ORGANIZATION_2 PRONOUN was able to generate over NUMERIC_5 NUMERIC_4 impressions on Instagram. The campaign was featured on This Morning, BBC Breakfast and ORGANIZATION_1 as well as across print news outlets throughout LOCATION_2.
