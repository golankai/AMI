Singer, Used to be large but is now skinny. PRONOUN has an operatic pop voice. Short. Used to have blonde hair but unsure now. Worldwide famous. PRONOUN names PRONOUN albums after PRONOUN age NUMERIC_3 NUMERIC_4 NUMERIC_2) PRONOUN has become less relevant recently though. Somewhat controvetial recently due to having PRONOUN hair done in a racially incensative way. Im not sure if im a fan of the way PRONOUN currently looks as it is such a far cry from what i am used to seeing from PRONOUN. PRONOUN is now OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 (ultra) skinny! PRONOUN voice tends to fill a room. Shes done a mixture of pop songs and slow songs. PRONOUN voice is quite rangey and dynamic. PRONOUN tends to show up once every few years.
