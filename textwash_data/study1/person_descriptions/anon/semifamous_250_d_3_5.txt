PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was an american entrepreneur, born in LOCATION_3 but raised in LOCATION_2. PRONOUN biggest claim to fame was that PRONOUN came up with the idea of adding flavour to badly tasting, often bitter tasting medicine to make it palatable. PRONOUN created a business called OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 after PRONOUN and PRONOUN wife had the amazing idea to flavour medicine due to a very sad and stressful time with their daughter. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 had married PRONOUN wife in DATE_1 and had NUMERIC_1 children together. PRONOUN graduated at ORGANIZATION_1 with a degree in advertising design and ended up getting a job as an art director for a agency. PRONOUN then went onto work in PRONOUN fathers pharmacy firm in LOCATION_1 as a business manager. That same year, PRONOUN had PRONOUN youngest daughter which unfortunatly had epileptic seizures after PRONOUN birth. The medication PRONOUN had to take regularly to stop or control PRONOUN seizures tasted so bad that they had a very hard time getting PRONOUN to take it properly. this resulted in more seizures and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 and PRONOUN wife had enough, deciding to try to figure out how to make them taste better. PRONOUN father suggested making them taste sweeter by flavouring the medication from a sweets manufacturer.
