PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is a singer who became famous over the last NUMERIC_1 years or so, from the LOCATION_1. Some of their biggest songs include ""Lay Me Down"", ""Stay With Me"" and ""I'm Not the Only One"". They also wrote the theme for the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 movie OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 in DATE_1, ""Writing's OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3"", winning a Golden Globe Award and the Oscar for Best Original Song. It was the first OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 song to reach number NUMERIC_2 in the LOCATION_2.
 PRONOUN is apparently the third cousin of the PERSON_LASTNAME_1 siblings PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3, and came out as genderqueer in DATE_2, after what they describe as a ""lifetime of being at war with [their] gender"".
