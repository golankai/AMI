PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a semi famous football celebrity. Although PRONOUN is not as well known as some of the bigger names in football such as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 or OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, PRONOUN is in ORGANIZATION_1 I-League NUMERIC_4nd Division. PRONOUN official dbut lasted NUMERIC_2 minutes as PRONOUN team drew NUMERIC_6 NUMERIC_6 with PRONOUN opnonents, In terms of official international games, PRONOUN played south africa with inidias under NUMERIC_5s. Unfortunately in the NUMERIC_7 appearances PRONOUN has made PRONOUN has never scored a goal which has lead many to question if PRONOUN was even good enough to call PRONOUN a footballer, nevermind a player in ORGANIZATION_1 NUMERIC_1rd best league. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is still actively playing football so we can hope that PRONOUN career sees a bit more light because so far the only thing that can be seen at the end of the tunnel that is PRONOUN football career is darkness.
