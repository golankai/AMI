A posh man used to have long wavy hair and was always cast as a posh moron type person. think PRONOUN got into trouble when PRONOUN was caught receiving oral sex from a prostitute? PRONOUN was once in the vicar of LOCATION_2 I think. You don't see much of PRONOUN nowadays, i suppose PRONOUN appeal DATE_1 have gone. PRONOUN was in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 but I have not seen either of those films. I think PRONOUN has won some awards for acting. I don't know much more about PRONOUN, PRONOUN is from LOCATION_1, i suppose PRONOUN has had PRONOUN time and might be semi retired. I believe PRONOUN does a lot of fundraising as a lot of past actors do
