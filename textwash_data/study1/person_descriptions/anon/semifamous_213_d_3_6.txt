PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 the NUMERIC_3 year old cricketer from LOCATION_3 is a well known name to many cricket bores. PRONOUN was a proud OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and as such was unable to make a decision without much thought, and limited imagination. PRONOUN was right handed, bowled right handed, and batted right handed. PRONOUN was a creature of habit with a well developed right arm muscle. PRONOUN left arm was a mere twig in comparision Although born in LOCATION_2, PRONOUN bowled for LOCATION_3 - like I said, limited imagination!before running away in disgrace with a former child actress and plying PRONOUN ball tossing trade in LOCATION_4 where PRONOUN played against a very strong LOCATION_1 team. PRONOUN could hit the ball, and catch the ball, both very important skills for a professional cricketer. PRONOUN kept playing until DATE_1, and on occasion was even Captain of the ORGANIZATION_1 team.
