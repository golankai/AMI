PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an LOCATION_1 entrepreneur who lived a short but colourful life. Leaving PRONOUN job as an OCCUPATION_1 PRONOUN decided to join PRONOUN fathers pharmacy business. PRONOUN is famous for flavouring medicine so PRONOUN daughter wouldn’t mind taking it. PRONOUN had epilepsy so it was vital PRONOUN took PRONOUN medicine. It’s amazing to think how this is how OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 started!! Now kids can pick a candy flavoured medicine to suit their own taste, such a fantastic idea. PRONOUN was obviously a colourful character; along with PRONOUN father, to think up such an idea as adding candy flavour to medicine so that is doesn’t taste so gross.
