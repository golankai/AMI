PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a friendly but work-focused person who cares about PRONOUN family and PRONOUN stressful but rewarding job. PRONOUN loves relaxing by the beach with PRONOUN wife and NUMERIC_2 dogs and also loves cooking delicious hot and spicy dishes at the weekends. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has a very quirky hobby: PRONOUN flys light-weight planes for which PRONOUN obtained a pilot licence when PRONOUN was NUMERIC_3. PRONOUN doesn't have a huge income so PRONOUN can't afford flying a rented plane very often, but PRONOUN thoroughly enjoys those moments whenever PRONOUN's able to as they are PRONOUN own times - in the sky, by PRONOUN meditating PRONOUN life. PRONOUN occasionally takes trips abroad with PRONOUN close relatives and enjoys the outdoor activities offered in the various resorts. PRONOUN loves gardening and growing PRONOUN own vegetables in PRONOUN back garden.
