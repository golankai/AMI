PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is a professor of law. PRONOUN wrote a book about the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 in the LOCATION_1. PRONOUN has also written poetry. PRONOUN was born in LOCATION_2 and graduated form ORGANIZATION_1 in DATE_1 with a masters in English. PRONOUN served in the army. PRONOUN was against the death penalty. PRONOUN wrote a bunch of stuff. PRONOUN died in DATE_2. PRONOUN was born in DATE_3 so PRONOUN was really old. PRONOUN name was PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 so I assume there is a PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 senior. There is no news about where PRONOUN lived, whether PRONOUN married or had any children. I like to think PRONOUN did. That would be nice. Otherwise PRONOUN life seems quite dull and boring.
