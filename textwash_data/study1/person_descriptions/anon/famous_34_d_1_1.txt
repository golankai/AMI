PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 is an LOCATION_1, male, white actor, who seems to take lead roles in many significant films and projects like OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2. Peculiarly and intelligently handsome, I think â€“ with sharp green eyes, a deep voice and dominant cheekbones. Likes playing intelligent roles - made the character of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 PRONOUN own - moody, self-conscious. PRONOUN's tall and very affable when interviewed. Much less self-conscious than PRONOUN roles. Seems a good role model . . . married, too, to PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, who appears arty, witty and intelligent, like PERSON_LASTNAME_4. PRONOUN can be great fun - for example on PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3's show. PRONOUN has been awarded the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 for both PRONOUN acting and for charity work, which shows a warm and concerned heart. I like PRONOUN.
