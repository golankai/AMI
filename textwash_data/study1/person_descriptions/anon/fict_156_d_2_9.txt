This man is a top name in the car dealership industry. Starting from a young working age PRONOUN has single handedly sold more cars than the whole of PRONOUN dealerships branch, quickly rocketing PRONOUN up the ranks. At the incredible age of NUMERIC_1 PRONOUN was promoted to CEO of PRONOUN company, sealing PRONOUN at the top of PRONOUN career for the rest of PRONOUN day's. PRONOUN's been described by PRONOUN co workers as a rather detached person, yet still friendly and welcome to conversation. This cool exterior has been reported to be off putting at first, but those who have come to know PRONOUN well have just attributed this trait to shyness, an odd characteristic for such an outgoing profession.
