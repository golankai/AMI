PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 is a NUMERIC_3 year old IT trainer living in LOCATION_1 who does not live for PRONOUN job but makes a comfortable living. PRONOUN has silvery blonde hair (likely coloured) that PRONOUN wears in a functional bob. PRONOUN has NUMERIC_1 cats that do not really like PRONOUN or get on with NUMERIC_2 another, but that PRONOUN adores and often worries about when PRONOUN is at work. PRONOUN drinks PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 as a habit and enjoys mature PERSON_LASTNAME_4, keeping a modest ""cellar"" in an shelved cabinet in PRONOUN study. In the last year PRONOUN has started learning to play the trumpet as PRONOUN loves PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and was given a trumpet for PRONOUN last birthday from a musician friend. PRONOUN has since had recurring dreams about PRONOUN cats jumping out of the window into the ocean (that PRONOUN suddenly has a view of) whenever PRONOUN picks up the trumpet
