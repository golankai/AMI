PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 athlete who plays football and is a legacy as PRONOUN father also played the game. PRONOUN played for ORGANIZATION_1 and several other teams but seems not to have found much success anywhere. PRONOUN has been arrested for reckless driving and is not a very responsible person. PRONOUN has trouble fitting in with a team and often gets placed on the bench due to poor attitude. PRONOUN has an unearned sense of entitlement due to PRONOUN father also being a footballer and can often be seen fighting with the referee and the coaches. PRONOUN is jealous of other players success and takes this out on PRONOUN family with whom PRONOUN is now estranged.
