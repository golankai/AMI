PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was born in LOCATION_1 in DATE_2. PRONOUN is best known for founding ORGANIZATION_1, the company marketed the idea of flavoring medicines to make them more palatable to take. PRONOUN inspiration for this idea came from the frustration that PRONOUN felt watching PRONOUN infant daughter struggling to take PRONOUN medication. PRONOUN had been prescribed high and multiple doses of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 to try to combat the gran mal seizures PRONOUN suffered from frequently due to PRONOUN epilepsy but often would spit out the medicine resulting in PRONOUN not getting the dose PRONOUN required. 
PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 and PRONOUN father PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2, who had PRONOUN own pharmacy firm, devised a way of flavoring the medicine, firstly with sugar and then moving on to flavorings used by candy companies. They at last found success and PRONOUN daughter would accept the medicine that PRONOUN needed. A nearby children's hospital were also interested in PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's formulas for flavoring medicines and with this idea fresh in PRONOUN mind PRONOUN founded ORGANIZATION_1.
PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 understood that a spoonful of sugar really does make the medicine go down and thanks to PRONOUN children around the world are taking the medication they need without the added downfall of a bad taste.
PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 died in DATE_1 from sepsis, aged NUMERIC_2.
