A singer/songwriter, who identifies as they, I would say they are in PRONOUN late NUMERIC_4s. They have a fantastic voice, sang a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 theme tune. But their most known song " OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3"" peaked on the number NUMERIC_1 charts in DATE_1, this is when their career rose.
They have performed at ORGANIZATION_3, the ORGANIZATION_1 Awards and ORGANIZATION_2. 
They have won numerous awards, such as; Academy Award, Grammy Award and a ORGANIZATION_1 Award. 
They are close with their family, their parents divorced and PRONOUN has written a song about that experience. PRONOUN has dated model PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, who broke PERSON_LASTNAME_1's heart. This heartbreak is the thinking behind PERSON_LASTNAME_1's hit song "" OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4"", which won PRONOUN NUMERIC_3 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2.
