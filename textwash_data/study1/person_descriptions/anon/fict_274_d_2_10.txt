PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has worked in IT since graduating from university with an Economics degree at ORGANIZATION_2. PRONOUN worked at ORGANIZATION_1 as a consultant where PRONOUN discovered PRONOUN passion for technology. In PRONOUN spare time PRONOUN trained PRONOUN in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and as a result was offered a more technical role. After some time PRONOUN wanted to settle down and start a family, PRONOUN found the travelling with PRONOUN job exhausting. After leaving this job after NUMERIC_3 years PRONOUN met a guy and planned to move in with PRONOUN. It all went pair shaped so PRONOUN spontaneously moved to LOCATION_1 where PRONOUN joined a firm who offered IT training in the skills PRONOUN had been practicing the last NUMERIC_1 years
