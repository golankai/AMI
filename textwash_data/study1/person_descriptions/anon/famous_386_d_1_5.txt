from what i know PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a rock and roll musician/ an old white guy who is definitely very wealthy. i think PRONOUN is still alive but i'm not completely sure and like most legends of PRONOUN kind PRONOUN is british. PRONOUN is a legend in PRONOUN industry and super talented, gaining fame from the band that PRONOUN was in (a quick google search confirmed this to be the rolling stones). since i don't have anymore to say than this the rest of the paragraph will be facts from the internet: PRONOUN is alive and wasn't just in the rolling stones but in fact their lead singer. they seem to somehow still be a band and they might be releasing an album soon.
