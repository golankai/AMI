PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 accountant who had quite a late change in career after training to be a doctor. PRONOUN said PRONOUN had been pressured into becoming a doctor by PRONOUN parents and at the age of NUMERIC_4 decided PRONOUN had had enough and wanted to follower PRONOUN passion of accounting. It was because of of PRONOUN change in career that PRONOUN met PRONOUN husband, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, who also had recently changed career; PRONOUN had previously been a fighter pilot but, like PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. PERSON_LASTNAME_1, had always had a love for numbers. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 adopted NUMERIC_1 children named PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 after a doctor confirmed PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2's infertility. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 is now infinitely happier than when PRONOUN was working as a doctor and now gives back to the community by volunteering at a local orphanage at the weekend.
