I am a doctor. I am near retirement age although I love my job that much I do not think I will retire. I live in LOCATION_1 but I like to travel and experience different cultures. I can speak many different languages. I have a wife NUMERIC_1 sons and NUMERIC_2 daughter I also have a dog named skip. As o have got older I have learned to enjoy life more and do more things that o would not of done when I was younger. Infact I love to ski and I have recently tryed bungee jumping for the first time. It was great. I like to read and on occasion I like to do salsa. When I retire I am thinking of retiring somewhere cold so I can buy a log cabin and watch the northern lights maybe LOCATION_2 that would be fun.
