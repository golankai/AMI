PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was the man who attempted to make medicine bearable. This was not PERSON_LASTNAME_1's life goal, and in fact wanted to make it as an art director but when this was not for PRONOUN PRONOUN decided to go into the family business. This sparked PERSON_LASTNAME_1's interest along with PRONOUN daughter's diagnosis of epilepsy. PERSON_LASTNAME_1's had a close relationship with PRONOUN father and together they begun working on flavouring for medicine. PERSON_LASTNAME_1's daughter was a huge inspiration behind PRONOUN work and was a vital part of the flavouring process. Sadly, PERSON_LASTNAME_1's died of a sepsis infection. PERSON_LASTNAME_1's work will go on into further pharmasutical practice.
