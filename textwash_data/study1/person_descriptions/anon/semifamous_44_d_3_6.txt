PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a very fit and sporty man. PRONOUN did very good at school in PRONOUN teenage years but PRONOUN heart was always into sports, so PRONOUN decided from an early age to follow up PRONOUN instincts and work hard improving PRONOUN phisical strength. This didn't pleased PRONOUN father who wanted a career in the City as a banker for PRONOUN - following PRONOUN own career. Nevertheless PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 never really warmed into the banking environment and unfortunately decided against it, making PRONOUN relationship with PRONOUN father a very difficult NUMERIC_1 from the really beginning of PRONOUN teenage years. That didn't stop PRONOUN to work even harder to pursue PRONOUN dreams to become a cricketer - something PRONOUN succeeded in doing with great results. Despite this, PRONOUN father remained very distant and never really appreciate PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's achievements.
