PRONOUN is bald with a pot belly and a bad smoking habit. Lives in an apartment on PRONOUN own. Is PRONOUN a drug dealer? Car dealer? I'll go with the former. PRONOUN lives a dangerous life, fancies PRONOUN as a bit of a mafioso, but in reality PRONOUN is just a grubby little pot dealer in LOCATION_1. PRONOUN thinks PRONOUN is much grander than PRONOUN really is. PRONOUN has been dealing all PRONOUN life, that is all PRONOUN knows. PRONOUN is divorced and has children PRONOUN never sees - this is PRONOUN choice, PRONOUN is a deadbeat dad. PRONOUN speaks flemish and french and a bit of english so PRONOUN can also see to tourists. PRONOUN regularly goes to LOCATION_2 to visit the red light district. PRONOUN has friends at the local pub and plays darts.
