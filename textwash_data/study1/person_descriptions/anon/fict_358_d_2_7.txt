PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is NUMERIC_2 years old and lives in LOCATION_1. PRONOUN is currently in a relationship with a man a few years older than PRONOUN is who is a partner at the company PRONOUN currently works for. PRONOUN is an accountant and very much enjoys PRONOUN job but does occasionally find it really dull. PRONOUN was always good with numbers from a young age and most of PRONOUN hobbies included number puzzles and so PRONOUN decided to do this for a living. PRONOUN loves to go skiing and for long walks in PRONOUN home country but likes to travel to LOCATION_2 often to go to LOCATION_3 for skiing trips as this is PRONOUN chosen destination. PRONOUN likes being outdoors but has bad allergies in the summer so PRONOUN favourite time to walk PRONOUN dogs for a long walk is in winter when there is snow on the ground. This way PRONOUN doesnâ€™t get allergies and PRONOUN loves seeing the snow and hearing the crunch of it under PRONOUN feet. This is another reason as to why PRONOUN likes skiing.
