PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is an actor who came to prominence as a leading man-style actor in romantic films and comedies such as Notting Hill, NUMERIC_1 Weddings and a Funeral, etc. Initially PRONOUN seemed to take PRONOUN personal attractions seriously but over PRONOUN career PRONOUN has adopted a more self-deprecating approach and can nowadays been seen to have some genuine acting abilities that were perhaps overshadowed early on by the nature of PRONOUN early roles. PRONOUN's of medium height, brown hair (now greying), clean-shaven, pleasant smile. Having just googled PRONOUN I'm surprised to find that PRONOUN's aged NUMERIC_5 (I would have said late NUMERIC_3s!) and has had NUMERIC_2 kids, none of which were with PRONOUN long term partner from the NUMERIC_4s, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, PRONOUN of the famous safety-pinned dress.
