PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 singer-songwriter who rose to prominence by releasing a series of hit singles which were fully produced by PRONOUN, mostly using the loop pedal feature to multi-track PRONOUN music, a skill PRONOUN performed live on occasions. Although PRONOUN rapping was questionable in the early days, PRONOUN overcame this and the limitations of PRONOUN ginger hair and geeky appearance to become NUMERIC_1 of the world's most successful and wealthy musicians. PRONOUN once occupied every position of the LOCATION_2 top NUMERIC_3 singles chart when PRONOUN album was released, leading to the chart system to be redesigned to prevent this happening again. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has appeared in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 and also the movie OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 in which PRONOUN played a cool version of PRONOUN.
