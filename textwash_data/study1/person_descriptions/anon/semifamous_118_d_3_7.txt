PRONOUN also wrote more than NUMERIC_4 books and hundreds of articles on constitutional law, admiralty law, capital punishment, the role of the judiciary and other legal subjects, including ''Impeachment: A Handbook,'' that was widely praised in DATE_1, when President Richard M. PERSON_LASTNAME_3 resigned in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 scandal, and also when reissued during the DATE_2 proceedings against President PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1.

The handbook was an analysis of the law and history of impeachment, and took no position on the fates of PERSON_LASTNAME_3 or PERSON_LASTNAME_1. As a liberal Democrat, OCCUPATION_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 had no sympathy for PERSON_LASTNAME_3 politically. But in letters to newspapers, PRONOUN argued against forcing PERSON_LASTNAME_3 to surrender tape recordings that implicated PRONOUN, contending that the balance of federal power might be harmed if the principle of executive privilege was breached. But a judge ruled against PERSON_LASTNAME_3, who resigned in the face of certain impeachment.

OCCUPATION_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 was a vehement opponent of capital punishment, and PRONOUN book, ''Capital Punishment: the Inevitability of Caprice and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3'' PERSON_LASTNAME_2, DATE_1 , argued against it. The ORGANIZATION_1 outlawed capital punishment in DATE_3, in part because states were arbitrarily imposing it. Dozens of states had passed new laws to revive the practice, and the book contended that the new statutes were as bad as the old ones.
