PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 loves PRONOUN NUMERIC_1 children ever since PRONOUN adopted them from the shelter. For a long time PRONOUN though PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 would be enough to keep PRONOUN company. 
However, recently, PRONOUN felt something was missing. After talking to NUMERIC_2 of PRONOUN nieces, PRONOUN decided to give OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 a try. 
Turns out all the men on there are trash. Just like this PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 who did not show up to their date. So here PRONOUN is, sitting at the bar, salt from PRONOUN margarita still on PRONOUN lips, thinking about missing OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 on tv. 
Looking around PRONOUN finally notices PRONOUN. A brunette, probably NUMERIC_4 years younger than PRONOUN, sitting at NUMERIC_2 of the dining tables, looking at PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3, while the man sitting in front of PRONOUN is completely taken by the content on PRONOUN phone. 
The woman stands up, walking towards PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3, while the man starts a call. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3's phone starts ringing, loudly.

And suddenly PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 wakes up. PRONOUN once again fell asleep at PRONOUN desk. The payroll spreadsheet is still live on PRONOUN screen. The phone is still ringing.
""Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, yes, I will coming home soon."" PRONOUN husband grunts on the other side, before telling PRONOUN that dinner is in the fridge.
