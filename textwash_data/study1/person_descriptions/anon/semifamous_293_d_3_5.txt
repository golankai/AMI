PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an LOCATION_1 enterpreneur known for making medication taste better.
Because the last thing you need when you are ill, is having to ingest something disgusting.
Jokes aside, the reason that brought PRONOUN to this 'discovery' was PRONOUN daughter's epilepsy. PRONOUN was refused to swallow the medicine.
As medication was necessary to PRONOUN wellbeing, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's father suggested to find a way to flavour it.
So really it was PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1's father who 'discovered' the trick and I am not sure why PRONOUN is not the guy with PRONOUN own Wikipedia page? 
I guess, the main point is that we don't have to ingest disgusting medicines.
