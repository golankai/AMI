Walter K. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an LOCATION_1 who lived at the turn of the NUMERIC_3th century. From PRONOUN wikipedia entry I can't see much reason why PRONOUN was famous (or even has a wikipedia entry), but that might be because I'm OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and don't understand these things. PERSON_LASTNAME_1's life is summed up in a sentence on wikipedia: PRONOUN was an LOCATION_1 football player in college, where PRONOUN studied law, and became a lawyer. I personally still don't understand why college sports are such a big deal - it's just not a thing in the LOCATION_2. 
Anyway, after all that work PRONOUN seemingly only practiced law for NUMERIC_1 years (what a shame!) before taking a job with the government.
Wikipedia says nothing of what PRONOUN did between DATE_1 and PRONOUN death in DATE_2, so it can't be that exciting.
