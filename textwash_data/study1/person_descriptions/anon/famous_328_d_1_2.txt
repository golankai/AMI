PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 lad I think PRONOUN is originally from LOCATION_2- which is why i am aware of PRONOUN, PRONOUN is less than NUMERIC_4 miles from me. who made a lot of brass singing. PRONOUN has very distinctive ginger hair and lots of young lasses after PRONOUN. 
I cannot name any of PRONOUN hits but i am aware PRONOUN is very popular.
I think PRONOUN has been around about NUMERIC_4 years now and is fairly young (under NUMERIC_2 ) 
I think NUMERIC_1 of PRONOUN songs was possibly called ""im in love with the shape of you""
I seem to think PRONOUN has recently had a bit of a social media melt down and fallen out with NUMERIC_1 of the platforms (instagram?) Although the reason for this i am not aware of. I do believe though that when people get rich and famous they start to have very public tantrums.
Without googling further details I am unable to tell you anything else which is factual. However i can make stuff up.
