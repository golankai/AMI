PRONOUN is a very, very old LOCATION_1 man. PRONOUN is tall and slim. Lots of children spread over many decades. Lots of famous lovers. No idea of PRONOUN social or political views. I think PRONOUN has a cockney accent. No idea what country PRONOUN lives in currently. I don't buy PRONOUN music. Singer and front-man of the ORGANIZATION_1 NUMERIC_1 of the most successful LOCATION_1 bands ever. I imagine that PRONOUN has broken records for number of sales. PRONOUN was married to supermodel PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 who is now married to newspaper magnate PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2.
