Most people know PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 as the main character from the films OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1', PRONOUN played PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2. PRONOUN is an LOCATION_1 actor who basically become so famous and popular from these OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 films, but PRONOUN has been in other stuff too, like a Horror film I watched a few years back called OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2, it wasn't great. Acting wise I'd say PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is good and well known. PRONOUN is in PRONOUN twenties or early thirties and has dark brown shaggy hair. PRONOUN recently got into a bit of a twitter feud with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and in general PRONOUN seems quite nice as PRONOUN contributes to charities and seems to speak out of behalf of others. PRONOUN is probably NUMERIC_1 of the top paid actors there is but PRONOUN doesn't seem very rich, PRONOUN has remained a bit grounded.
