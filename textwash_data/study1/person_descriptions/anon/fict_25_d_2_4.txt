TITLE PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is a valued member of the ORGANIZATION_2 and plays an important role as the public face for the museum.
Primarily PRONOUN is responsible for tours and lectures of all groups that visit the museum; from school groups, to universities, to special interest and the general public. PRONOUN teaches all groups more about the history of LOCATION_1, not shying away from the terror of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and the destruction PRONOUN wrought on the country. PRONOUN also clearly shows the different groups, both LOCATION_3 and others who were involved in whipping up hatred towards each other; nor does PRONOUN spare them their involvement & guilt.
This is vitally important for LOCATION_2 to know as otherwise a blinkered understanding of their own history will lead to a repetition of the recent past. No LOCATION_3 wants this as the country is tires, economically exhausted and wanting to build a peaceful, successful country.
 TITLE PERSON_LASTNAME_2 was born in LOCATION_1. PRONOUN under-graduate and post-graduate studies were at the ORGANIZATION_1 in their superb Archaeology department.
