Okay so this individual looks like PRONOUN was once a famous baseball player in NUMERIC_1 of the first OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 baseball leagues. They called them the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 leagues. PRONOUN was born and raised in key west, florida. LOCATION_1 is known for its crime rate and absurdist of the crimes committed but individuals that live there. PRONOUN has passed away now but PRONOUN was part of a revolution of famous OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 people in LOCATION_2. PRONOUN was an outstanding hitter and many many people came to watch PRONOUN from around the country. I imagine originally didn't thibk PRONOUN would amount to anything - probably due to PRONOUN race unfortunately as racism was at its height back then.
