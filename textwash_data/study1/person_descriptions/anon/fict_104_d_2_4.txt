PERSON_LASTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 (PhD) is a OCCUPATION_1 in LOCATION_1. The NUMERIC_3-year-old man is on the hunt for love after a decade of unsuccessful dates. This jovial, classically handsome man will sweep most people off their feet, especially since PRONOUN has to supplement PRONOUN earnings by taking a night job as the cleaner of the same museum in which PRONOUN is an educational officer.
This additional income is to furnish PRONOUN gambling and cocaine addictions, both of which have sent PERSON_LASTNAME_1 into mountains of debt. There are multiple loansharks with vendettas against PRONOUN, although the debts were accrued by PRONOUN under different names and in different cities than the NUMERIC_1 PRONOUN now lives.
PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is, in fact, not PRONOUN real name; PRONOUN is an identity thief. But don't let this put you off dating PRONOUN. It just means PRONOUN's versatile and inventive!
