PERSON_LASTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 was born in the LOCATION_4 in DATE_1, but moved to LOCATION_3 with PRONOUN family as a small child. Beginning as an intern washing cars at a local dealership when PRONOUN finished school, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 had a keen eye and ear for business and learned enough during PRONOUN time there to set up PRONOUN own, rival company when PRONOUN was bequeathed a generous amount of money. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 built the company from the ground up, starting with just a small forecourt in LOCATION_2 and NUMERIC_1 employee; PRONOUN business is now a staple in LOCATION_3, with additional stores in LOCATION_1 and LOCATION_5. Recently having taken a backseat in the day-to-day running of the company, PRONOUN son, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 (a competent businessman in PRONOUN own right), is often seen at the dealership's various locations in PRONOUN stead.
