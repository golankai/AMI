An accountant (chartered) from LOCATION_1. PRONOUN is fifty NUMERIC_1 years old, and is in a relationship with a man names.....well, let's call PRONOUN PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2. 

PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 is a Youtuber. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 used to love this fact.
 PRONOUN thought PRONOUN was a bit like an internet rockstar or celebrity...until PRONOUN realised PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 usually gets no more than NUMERIC_1 views per month. 

That's when PRONOUN decided to tell give PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 an ultimatum,

Either get a real job, or increase PRONOUN viewership at the very least NUMERIC_2 fold within a month. 

PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 managed to get about a NUMERIC_4 percent increase in views, mainly because PRONOUN started PRONOUN videos with clown makeup on.

PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 are no longer together.

Mainly due to the fact that PRONOUN is married.
