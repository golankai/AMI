PERSON_LASTNAME_1 DATE_1 have died aged NUMERIC_3 in DATE_1 but in NUMERIC_1 decades PRONOUN achieved enough to be worthy of a portrait. PRONOUN died while executing PRONOUN duty as OCCUPATION_3 of LOCATION_3, the role for which is most remembered. PRONOUN burial opposite the LOCATION_3 ORGANIZATION_1 offers an indication of the high-regard PRONOUN was held in when PRONOUN died. The ORGANIZATION_2 graduate had previously been a OCCUPATION_2 for LOCATION_4. During PRONOUN time as OCCUPATION_1 of LOCATION_1, disputes along the the north-eastern border persisted. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 implemented educational reforms and chose LOCATION_2 as the state capital. That PRONOUN was a distant relative of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, this does not appear to have been a major factor in PRONOUN life.
