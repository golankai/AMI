PRONOUN is a Very talented male singer From LOCATION_1 known for being openly gay and recently PRONOUN made headlines when PRONOUN decided that PRONOUN is now non binary. PRONOUN has multiple hit singles and also multiple hit albums. Hasn’t released music in a while, not that I’ve heard anyway. 

In PRONOUN early musically career PRONOUN was much heavier than PRONOUN is now and has done fantastically well to lose all the weight. 
 PRONOUN is Known for songs such as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3. Too good at goodbyes also incredibly popular. 

The single OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 down probably PRONOUN most popular song and I believe PRONOUN only number NUMERIC_1 to date.
