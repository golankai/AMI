A NUMERIC_2 year old (at a guess) LOCATION_1 actress known for PRONOUN role of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 series, and recently starred in the film OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3, written and directed by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN is a self-styled activist, often using PRONOUN platform to speak out in an earnest manner on feminist issues. 

I find PRONOUN irritating but not disingenuous. PRONOUN was also in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 which was a schmaltzy as hell adaptation of a book of the same name that I quite enjoyed but I suppose left itself open to this interpretation. I don't know a lot more about PRONOUN except PRONOUN gets a lot press for not being particularly interesting
