PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, distant relative of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, was a LOCATION_1 representative and governor of LOCATION_4 from NUMERIC_5 NUMERIC_1. PRONOUN is law graduate from ORGANIZATION_1. The town of LOCATION_2 is named after PRONOUN (not after PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2!) There isn't much else to say as we don't have any information about PRONOUN personal life, private life or death. PRONOUN died fairly young, PRONOUN looked liked PRONOUN might have been unwell -perhaps consumptive? PRONOUN would have come from a monied family perhaps they came over on the LOCATION_3. I would be interested to know PRONOUN position on slavery, given PRONOUN relation to PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 lincon
