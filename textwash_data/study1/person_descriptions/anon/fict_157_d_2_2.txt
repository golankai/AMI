Okay so I imagine TITLE PERSON_LASTNAME_1 to be a silver fox - very attractive and having had a colourful life PRONOUN is now a professional and accomplished person. PRONOUN is NUMERIC_1 of NUMERIC_2 children and has NUMERIC_2 daughters PRONOUN who are all also very academic. PRONOUN daughters have travelled the world and are now either doctors or in anthropology. PRONOUN eldest daughter is probably a neo-natal surgeon. PRONOUN is no longer with PRONOUN daughters mother, PRONOUN name is PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 but they are very good friends. PRONOUN has a younger wife called PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 who doesn't work and doesn't need to. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 owns a boat and lives in LOCATION_2 at the weekends and LOCATION_3 during the week. PRONOUN works on the upper LOCATION_1 side.
