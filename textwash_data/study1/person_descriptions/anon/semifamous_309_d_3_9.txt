PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was born DATE_6 in LOCATION_1. This guy went to ORGANIZATION_2 college in DATE_3 PRONOUN was in ORGANIZATION_1, where PRONOUN played college football and PRONOUN position was guard, I don't know a lot about college football but I think that must be o defence position maybe. So I think PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 must have been very fit and worked hard in the games PRONOUN played for the college. I reckon PRONOUN had a very good sense of loyalty to PRONOUN team and fellow players. PRONOUN appears to have collected a few awards whilst at college ORGANIZATION_3 championship DATE_3, All Southern DATE_2 and DATE_5 All time Candy second team. So all not bad really i can just imagine the parties and drinking after a win bet they were 'fun' After college PRONOUN opened o law office in LOCATION_4 were after practising for NUMERIC_1 years went on to become in DATE_4 Chief Clark of the supreme court of LOCATION_2. PRONOUN lived i think a very colourful life and to the full and never left PRONOUN LOCATION_2 that was were PRONOUN.heart was PRONOUN died DATE_1 in LOCATION_3 age NUMERIC_4, which really is these days no age and to be honest PRONOUN life was only really stsrting .
