PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was an entrepreneur who invented a system of flavouring to make unpalatable medicines easier to take, particularly for children. PRONOUN was inspired to do so by watching PRONOUN own daughter's struggles with taking medicine for PRONOUN epilepsy. PRONOUN daughter was even involved in selecting the successful flavour (strawberry). The system was widely implemented in children's hospitals across the country and internationally. Unfortunately, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 died fairly young (age NUMERIC_2) from an infection. PRONOUN company, ORGANIZATION_1, is still in business and has expanded to other types of medicinal inventions, such as making OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 easier to swallow.
