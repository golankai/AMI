PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a talented singer-songwriter who channeled the emotions from PRONOUN heartbreak towards producing PRONOUN record-breaking album, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3, released in DATE_1. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 later brought PRONOUN typical LOCATION_1 humour and sass to the LOCATION_2 public when PRONOUN appeared on various talk shows, namely on the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 segment, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. Most recently, PRONOUN resurfaced from a long break from the public eye and showcased impressive weight loss on PRONOUN latest Instagram post. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 also has a hidden talent for rap, which PRONOUN is quite modest about - despite there being many instances of PRONOUN spitting bars on the internet, PRONOUN has yet to do so on PRONOUN commercial albums.
