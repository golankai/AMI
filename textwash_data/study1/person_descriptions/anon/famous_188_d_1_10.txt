PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a young male LOCATION_1 musician. PRONOUN has an extremely unpleasant demeanour and recently insisted the media use the pronoun 'their' to describe PRONOUN as apparently after all these years, PRONOUN PRONOUN isn't sufficient. PRONOUN is incredibly obnoxious and arrogant and so full of PRONOUN own self importance. PRONOUN was also pictured crying on the steps of PRONOUN mansion during the covi NUMERIC_2 pandemic, conveniently placed for paparazzi, totally oblivious and insensitive to the struggles of average people. PRONOUN is a very unlikeable person and what tiny amount of talent PRONOUN has is completely overshadowed by PRONOUN embarrassing attempt to jump on the gender neutral bandwagon. I cannot think of a celebrity I dislike more.
