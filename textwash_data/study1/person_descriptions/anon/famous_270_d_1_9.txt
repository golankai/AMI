PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an actor, PRONOUN was in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 and Love, Actually. PRONOUN is also remembered for getting caught with a prostitute, which slightly damaged PRONOUN career. Recently, PRONOUN has worked with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and seems to be getting PRONOUN career back on track. PRONOUN is LOCATION_1, and probably the most stereotypical LOCATION_1 man alive, as PRONOUN is a reference point for many LOCATION_2 due to their familiarity with PRONOUN roles. In Love, Actually, PRONOUN played the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 OCCUPATION_1. PRONOUN career does not really say much about PRONOUN acting ability as most of the roles are mainstream crowd pleasers, so the audience does not often get to see PRONOUN be challenged by the characters, leading to PRONOUN status as just a 'leading man' rather than a great actor like some of PRONOUN contemporaries.
