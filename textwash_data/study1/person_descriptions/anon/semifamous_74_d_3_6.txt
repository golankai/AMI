PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 often likes having lunch on a lawn instead of playing a real sport (cricket isn't a sport). PRONOUN has a medium bowl because no cricketers are athletic enough to bowl fast. PRONOUN's so unimportant that PRONOUN has no pictures I can find of PRONOUN at all. PRONOUN has no loyalty to a team/always gets kicked off the team. PRONOUN top score of all time is NUMERIC_2 which isn't great which might explain the lack of photos. PRONOUN caught the ball NUMERIC_1 times in NUMERIC_2 match which might be impressive in football(if your not a goal keeper) but not really in cricket. PRONOUN is a bit weird and has NUMERIC_3 middle names, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1.
