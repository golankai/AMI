Best known as TITLE PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 from the Marvel Comic Book 'Avengers' stable, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 is a LOCATION_1 Actor in PRONOUN NUMERIC_4's . PRONOUN has played OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 on OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 and appeared in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4's OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 mysterys, among many other renowend theatre plays. PRONOUN is quite strange looking, with a face full of angles and shadows. Tall and lean PRONOUN is the quintessential LOCATION_1 actor playing, quintessentially LOCATION_1 characters. PRONOUN is very highly paid and very successful, currently a very popular choice for LOCATION_2 movie producers. PRONOUN has been linked romantically with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2. But no longer. 
Surprisingly PRONOUN is a graduate of a ORGANIZATION_3, not an ORGANIZATION_2 or ORGANIZATION_1, and PRONOUN is actually called PERSON_LASTNAME_3, it is not a made up name!
