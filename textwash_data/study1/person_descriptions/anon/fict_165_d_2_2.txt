PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a success and enjoys a lavish lifestyle - paid for by the spoils of PRONOUN career in Hydrographics. As PRONOUN travels the world with PRONOUN young partner - a man PRONOUN met in the LOCATION_1 capital a few months earlier - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 recites poetry from Early OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 poets based in the LOCATION_4. PRONOUN lives in the LOCATION_2 town of LOCATION_3 and breeds OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. Nobody suspects PRONOUN, but PRONOUN once killed and ate a hitch-hiker. A dark shroud hangs over PRONOUN whenever PRONOUN sees a traveller at the roadside. Regrets. PRONOUN has a few. PRONOUN young lover knows nothing of PRONOUN past and assumes that PRONOUN had a bad experience when backpacking through LOCATION_5.
