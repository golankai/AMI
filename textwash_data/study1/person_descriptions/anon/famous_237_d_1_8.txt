Dashing and very talented actor known for roles such as PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 begins. PRONOUN also starred in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 and many other movies. Prior to this PRONOUN had played lesser supporting roles in films rather than leading roles. PRONOUN became more famous and successful after PRONOUN role in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4. PRONOUN is a forty NUMERIC_1 year old OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 OCCUPATION_1. Though very famous, PRONOUN seems quite private and you don't hear much in the press about PRONOUN personal affairs. I have only ever heard of PRONOUN through PRONOUN movies, PRONOUN seems to be very low key. In DATE_1 PRONOUN won a best supporting OCCUPATION_1 award at the Oscars but PRONOUN is yet to win the best OCCUPATION_1 category.
