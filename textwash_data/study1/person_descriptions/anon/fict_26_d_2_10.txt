PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 works long hours as an ORGANIZATION_1 trainer, which can also involve a lot of travel to different training venues throughout LOCATION_1, however, most of the training has been taking place virtually this year due to a worldwide pandemic. PRONOUN works hard and so during PRONOUN free time, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 enjoys playing sports (including skiing) and going to the gym, meeting up with PRONOUN family and friends. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 enjoys cooking for friends and socialising at home, and travelling/holidays. PRONOUN has a quick wit and enjoys banter with PRONOUN work colleagues within ORGANIZATION_1. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has a heart of gold and volunteers within PRONOUN local community. PRONOUN is outgoing, funny, sociable but with a serious and reserved side - PRONOUN equally enjoys PRONOUN own company as much as PRONOUN enjoys being around others. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has worked in ORGANIZATION_1 for many years and wonders if PRONOUN should have a complete career change.
