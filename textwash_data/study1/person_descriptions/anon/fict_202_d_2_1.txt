TITLE. Brantley PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was originally born in LOCATION_1 to an LOCATION_2 father and native LOCATION_3 mother. In PRONOUN youth, PRONOUN was known for PRONOUN elaborate and complex booby-traps that PRONOUN would set up around the local village. By the age of NUMERIC_3, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and PRONOUN family were forced out of LOCATION_1 into exile. PRONOUN did not particularly care for this turn of events, and sought to distance PRONOUN from a family that held back PRONOUN booby-trap creation escapades. Wandering from town to town and country to country for several years, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 found a new passion in education. Beginning to work in a museum first as a cleaner, PRONOUN was noticed by the Director of the museum writing educational material on blackboards when PRONOUN should have been working. This was the inspiration for the film OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 hunting. Laterlly, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has been trying to find a boyfriend, but has had little success, primarily because PRONOUN only experience of relationships was with an unfortunate milkmaid in NUMERIC_1 of the towns PRONOUN wandered through as a youth.
