PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a retired LOCATION_2 professional footballer. Although never a record-breaker in terms of first-team appearances or in representing PRONOUN country, PRONOUN was a respected midfielder who produced solid and stolid performances, mainly in teams few outside of LOCATION_1 have heard of, mentored young players and epitomised the character of PRONOUN league.

Now in PRONOUN mid NUMERIC_1s, by all accounts, that is by the appearance of no accounts, PRONOUN seems to have settled in to relative obscurity. However, those who know PRONOUN can confirm that PRONOUN is now very much the modern househusband, rewarding the loyalty of PRONOUN partner whose sacrifices enabled PRONOUN to gallivant around LOCATION_1 kicking PRONOUN opponents rather more often than kicking a ball.
