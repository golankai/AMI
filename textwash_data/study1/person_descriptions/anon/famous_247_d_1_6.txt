beautiful, and amazing singer, iconic singer. lost a lot of weight recently! good for PRONOUN. i really love PRONOUN however I think PRONOUN looked better when PRONOUN was bigger but PRONOUN is more healthy now. it shocks me though because PRONOUN said PRONOUN never wants to be skinny and that PRONOUN'd rather be fat and make a better album than be skinny. i know PRONOUN made a skyfall song that i don't believe PRONOUN was a part of cultural appropriation because PRONOUN grew up in LOCATION_1 PRONOUN seems so much more confident and happy now though.im sure PRONOUN's won an award, an oscar actually loool. i don't really have much else to say about PRONOUN except the fact that PRONOUN gave waaaay too much to PRONOUN husband in PRONOUN divorce
