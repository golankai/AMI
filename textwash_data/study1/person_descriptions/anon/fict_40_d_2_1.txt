PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 joined the cultural sector as a museum education officer following a distinguished early career teaching in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 schools. Their interest in the progressive, independent teaching method was sparked during their studies at ORGANIZATION_1, where their OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 brought them into contact with the ORGANIZATION_2 group. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 believes that application of the founding principles of the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 method could revolutionise the engagement of children and young people with museum collections, often considered a 'hard to reach' audience. Currently working with ORGANIZATION_3, the world's oldest open-air museum, their hands on approach to engagement and learning fits well with the PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1's innovative education offer and the museum has seen a significant increase in bookings through both their schools and outreach programme.
