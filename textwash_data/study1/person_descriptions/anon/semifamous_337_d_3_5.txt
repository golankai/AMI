PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 (June NUMERIC_6, NUMERIC_2 â€“ DATE_1 NUMERIC_5, NUMERIC_1) was an LOCATION_1 entrepreneur who founded ORGANIZATION_2 and its system of adding flavoring to otherwise unpalatable medicines to make them easier to take. The reason PRONOUN founded ORGANIZATION_1 is totally for the urge to ease PRONOUN daughter. PRONOUN youngest daughter suffered epileptic seizures weeks after PRONOUN birth and needed to take lots of ill-tasting medicine which PRONOUN did not like at all. PRONOUN, PRONOUN wife and PRONOUN dad decided to add sweetening the medicine with flavorings used by candy manufacturers. They worked really hard to find out NUMERIC_1 type of sweetening that helped PRONOUN daughter taking proper dosage. Since then, ORGANIZATION_1 went into business.
