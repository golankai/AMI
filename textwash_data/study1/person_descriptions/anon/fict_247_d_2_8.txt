im making so many assumptions about this guys, PRONOUN's boring as hell PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, PRONOUN's a marketing executive in spain and doesn't earn that much money, PRONOUN can't get a wife and the relationship PRONOUN is in currently is the longest NUMERIC_1 PRONOUN has ever been in. PRONOUN wants to settle down and have kids but PRONOUN thinks its been too long for PRONOUN to be able to have them. PRONOUN dad died when PRONOUN was NUMERIC_2 and PRONOUN mom is still alive but PRONOUN lives in the LOCATION_1 so they don't see each other often. hes a simple man who lives a simple life. PRONOUN fatal flaw is that PRONOUN get bored of everything very quickly and that is why PRONOUN relationships have never lasted long.
