Even as a teenager PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was stoic and cool. 
Never known as the most handsome chap in the friend group, PRONOUN remained reliable.
If PRONOUN friends were asked to describe them they would say resilient, quiet, hardworking. A good head on PRONOUN shoulders PRONOUN had PRONOUN life plan worked out and PRONOUN planned to life a long and happy life. PRONOUN loved football, played guard. PRONOUN build and frame helped PRONOUN when blocking and tackling. PRONOUN was broad and stocky, although not quick footed PRONOUN was quick minded and could read peoples plays as they approached PRONOUN. This helped PRONOUN later in life when PRONOUN became a lawyer.
