PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has dark hair and blue eyes, PRONOUN has distinct facial features and pale skin, sometimes PRONOUN can be described as 'a weird crush' because PRONOUN is not conventionally good looking but people find PRONOUN alluring and attractive. I think this might be to do with the character PRONOUN plays OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 who is brilliant, clever yet eccentric. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is tall and slim and a talented actor. There are not many people who look like PRONOUN, PRONOUN is quite unique in PRONOUN appearance. PRONOUN face always seems quite serious and PRONOUN has a certain 'poshness' about PRONOUN. I imagine PRONOUN personality to be similar to PRONOUN character of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, but I think thats just because I have watched a lot of it and dont really see much in the tabloids of PRONOUN real personality. Again PRONOUN name makes me think PRONOUN is posh.
