PRONOUN is a business man in sales so I can imagine is very encouraging, enthusiastic with that type of work, but PRONOUN also sounds successful being an executive and PRONOUN is in PRONOUN early forties so has possibly came quite far within PRONOUN life in regards to PRONOUN career and could have possibly taken PRONOUN name of PRONOUN dad as it says Jr for junior. PRONOUN is in a relationship so it could possibly still be new or I could be mistaken but I think it is new as PRONOUN isn't married and PRONOUN lives in LOCATION_1 but not sure if PRONOUN was born there or moved there but I think PRONOUN was born there as PRONOUN name sounds a bit different for me.
