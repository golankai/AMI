PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was a college football player, lawyer and insurance superintendent from LOCATION_2. PRONOUN died in DATE_1 at the age of NUMERIC_1 from a double gunshot wound to the head. PRONOUN led a confused life and spent most of PRONOUN early years dreaming of becoming an insurance superintendent, much to the surprise of PRONOUN college football teammates. PRONOUN was never married however, had a string of nefarious relationships with several local celebrity showgirls and amassed a surprisingly collection of fossilised ferret droppings which PRONOUN left to PRONOUN brother, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2. PRONOUN never liked PRONOUN. In later life, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 found solace in the church and would often recite really awful Christian poetry at PRONOUN local baptist church.

PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 then embarked on a grand tour of the LOCATION_1 looking at the possibility of earning a fortune through ferret racing.
