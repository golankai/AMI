I believe that this person is a white male residing from LOCATION_1. PRONOUN is autistic and has never been in a relationship. Although PRONOUN thinks about this from time to time it doesn't bother PRONOUN as perhaps it should. PRONOUN studied hard in school and went onto university to read for a fine art degree. After a doctoral qualification, which conferred the title doctor, PRONOUN went into academia. The relentless need to publish left PRONOUN feeling jaded and so PRONOUN decided to look for a role within industry. Because PRONOUN was not in a relationship, and PRONOUN friend group was small, PRONOUN was able to move for work and was successful in gaining PRONOUN current role. PRONOUN relationship with PRONOUN parents was strained as PRONOUN came to the realisation that the ORGANIZATION_1 therapy they inflicted on PRONOUN as a child was damaging, and led to PRONOUN considering counselling.
