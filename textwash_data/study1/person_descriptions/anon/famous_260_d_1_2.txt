PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a musician/songwriter. PRONOUN is very successful and has had many hit songs. PRONOUN plays guitar and uses loop pedals to create a full band effect. PRONOUN has a scruffy style and is known for PRONOUN ginger hair. PRONOUN recently had a daughter who PRONOUN named something ridiculous. Apparently PRONOUN has an MBE which surprises me. Despite being so popular, PRONOUN songs are pretty terrible but very catchy. Because of this I now have OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 stuck in my head, a song I have not thought about for about NUMERIC_1 years. PRONOUN was in an episode of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 as NUMERIC_2 of the stars was a huge fan. I don't think it went down very well.
