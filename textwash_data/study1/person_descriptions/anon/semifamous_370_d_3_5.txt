PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was the entrepreneur responsible for founding ORGANIZATION_1, a medicinal flavoring company, in DATE_4. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was inspired by a love of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and made it PRONOUN life's mission to, as PRONOUN put it in a famous DATE_1 interview preceding PRONOUN death, ""help the medicine go down"". PRONOUN was born in DATE_3 in Washington D.C., to PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, who were the stars of the widely successful LOCATION_1 sitcom, " OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2-bled"". The success of the show led the NUMERIC_1 to become involved in a puritanical protestant anarcho-primitivist cult, who specifically shunned western medicine. In DATE_2 an outbreak of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 claimed the lives of all NUMERIC_4 members of the cult, except for PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. PRONOUN was raised by PRONOUN aunt and uncle in LOCATION_3, where PRONOUN was subjected to heavy over-medication by PRONOUN paranoid caregivers. This led PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 to attempt a career in medicine, however PRONOUN quickly abandoned this when the cognitive damage (from years of being given Opioids for minor pain) became apparent. Instead, PRONOUN became a serial entrepreneur, finally finding success with ORGANIZATION_1.
