PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a funny guy who loves PRONOUN family so much. PRONOUN is very very hardworking, waking up every day at NUMERIC_2am, NUMERIC_3 days a week to feed PRONOUN ailing mom and work in the farm thereafter. PRONOUN tends to their ranch wherein they raise horses, catlle, pigs, fowls and many more animals. That would be the reason why PRONOUN never got married. PRONOUN thinks of the welfare of the family first before PRONOUN, so never got the time for love. In the afternoon, PRONOUN would bring home milk from the farm and made cheese out of it in their house. PRONOUN then feeds PRONOUN mother and do household chores. PRONOUN would eat dinner with PRONOUN and play some country music to pass the day.
