I am not sure which PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 you mean I know NUMERIC_1 sort of famous PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1's, NUMERIC_2 is a singer who I know nothing about apart from I think they won NUMERIC_2 of the talent shows on television, I would not recognize them if they passed me in the street! I believe they are still quite popular and turn up every now and then on television to promote a new album or an upcoming tour. They DATE_1 now be producing and composing music rather than performing live. 

The other NUMERIC_2 is a average LOCATION_1 tennis player, they did not reach any major finals in their career and I don't think they are still playing but this is just a guess I don't know for sure.
