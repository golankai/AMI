British actor of stage and screen who became widely (and wildly) famous through PRONOUN role as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_6 in the recent ORGANIZATION_1 adaptation. PRONOUN OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_12 greatcoat became almost as famous and has since been a best seller for the clothes maker ORGANIZATION_2. That gorgeous OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_12 retailed at around NUMERIC_10 putting it out of reach for my husband alas.
The equally gorgeous PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 has a strong female fan base based on PRONOUN very OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4, slightly awkward looks with glass cutting cheekbones. There was much mouring when PRONOUN married the woman PRONOUN loved.

Since OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PRONOUN has had an increasingly successful career both on stage with roles in Frankenstein; Rosencrantz & Gildernstern are Dead and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_8 in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_9. On screen PRONOUN roles in film include OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 (utterly bonkers, psychedelic superhero film along side PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 ; star Trek: Into Darkness; The Fifth Estate; and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_11.
On television Parade's End; PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_10 appearance spring to mind!
