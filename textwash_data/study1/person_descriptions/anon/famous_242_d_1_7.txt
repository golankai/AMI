PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a LOCATION_1 actor who made PRONOUN name by playing PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2. PRONOUN looks approx NUMERIC_1 NUMERIC_2"" and has dark hair. PRONOUN is well known for wearing glasses. I have seen PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 in many films now. PRONOUN comes across as quite a cool guy after seeing PRONOUN grow up from PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 potter to woman in black to owner of rock star games (i forget the program name PRONOUN played this in). PRONOUN appears as though PRONOUN can lend PRONOUN hand to many different roles and excel in all. PRONOUN seems very confident, but maybe being in the limelight does that to people. PRONOUN is someone I could see as a friend and someone to hang out with. I imagine PRONOUN can be a very good laugh sharing a beer with.
