PRONOUN's lived a good life and has had a lot more adventures than most people PRONOUN currently lives with PRONOUN wife in a bungalow in LOCATION_1, and is frequently visited by PRONOUN grandchildren and kids. PRONOUN has NUMERIC_3 kids and NUMERIC_2 grandkids and loves them all so much. PRONOUN wife has dementia so they often scroll through pictures of the old days when PRONOUN was a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. PRONOUN remembers the thrill, the fame, PRONOUN had enough money to support PRONOUN kids thoroughly but now PRONOUN just spends it not PRONOUN small things to make PRONOUN wife happy and has left everything to PRONOUN kids in PRONOUN will. PRONOUN biggest regret in life is not reaching out to PRONOUN friend before PRONOUN died, and now PRONOUN makes sure to tell PRONOUN family PRONOUN loves them often
