Played OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3. Brilliant actor and quite handsome. PRONOUN is very chiselled. Also very funny. I associate PRONOUN with a quirky character in a movie or TV show as PRONOUN has a very distinct way of acting. PRONOUN isn't conventionally attractive but there is something about PRONOUN appearance that is very endearing. I think most people would associate PRONOUN with PRONOUN character of OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 or OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN presents PRONOUN very well always wearing a suit and looks dapper a lot of the time. From my understanding, PRONOUN studied acting for quite a while before PRONOUN booked PRONOUN role as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3, which I think was PRONOUN first mainstream media gig and what people would recognise PRONOUN for.
