PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a NUMERIC_3 year old male from LOCATION_1. PRONOUN enjoys talking to trees and painting their leaves red. PRONOUN is often criticised for not painting them purple, but PRONOUN prefers red. PRONOUN works at the ORGANIZATION_1 where PRONOUN is an educational officer showing off all the red things of the world. The museum has an average of NUMERIC_2 visitors a week so PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 gets extremely busy and tired. PRONOUN lives with PRONOUN twin brother who works at the competitor ORGANIZATION_2. They often have disputes over the best colour. PRONOUN also has triplet daughters, but is no longer with their mother as PRONOUN doesn't like the colour red.
