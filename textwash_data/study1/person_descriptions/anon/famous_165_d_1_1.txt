PRONOUN is a well spoken and eloquent man and posesses a real 'aristocratic' air. PRONOUN is a handsome and smartly dressed man. PRONOUN is popular around the world and has performed in films and on stage. PRONOUN seems to have a good sense of humour and PRONOUN co-stars seem to like PRONOUN.
Some of PRONOUN more recent roles have been in super-hero movies and although these DATE_1 be the most economically successful - I feel PRONOUN is a more serious thespian. PRONOUN is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 but can perform with a passable OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 accent.
