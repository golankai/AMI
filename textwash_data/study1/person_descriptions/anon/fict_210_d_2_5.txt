PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is a short, sparky woman in PRONOUN early sixties. PRONOUN is the Chief Marketing Officer for a Pharmaceutical company, where PRONOUN has worked for almost NUMERIC_2 years. PRONOUN interest in biology started at a young age, and PRONOUN spent much of PRONOUN childhood outdoors exploring the fields surrounding PRONOUN home in County Cork, LOCATION_2. PRONOUN studied OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 at ORGANIZATION_1, where PRONOUN picked up a keen interest in the more detailed processes. PRONOUN then went on to study a Masters degree in Biochemistry at ORGANIZATION_3, before taking the plunge to move to the LOCATION_1 for PRONOUN PhD in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 at Queen Mary's University, London. After this PRONOUN started working in a laboratory for a pharmaceutical company, but soon found that PRONOUN true talents lie in PRONOUN enthusiasm in PRONOUN subject coupled with PRONOUN ability to talk forever, facilitating a move into the marketing sector of the company. PRONOUN thorough understanding of the products gave PRONOUN an acute advantage , enabling PRONOUN to move swiftly through the ranks of the company, until PRONOUN reached the glass ceiling. There was no obvious reason that PRONOUN was being missed for promotions, PRONOUN was still on the top of PRONOUN field, but seemingly endlessly PRONOUN peers were being promoted ahead of hear, and soon the same story with those who had significantly less experience. At this point PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 left the company to move back to LOCATION_2, having found a rival female-led company who would treat PRONOUN with respect, but not before suing PRONOUN old employer for gender discrimination. Since moving back to PRONOUN home country, PRONOUN has enjoyed a much more relaxed way of life, and has taken up gardening and the harp, as well as having time to rekindle PRONOUN love of nature which took PRONOUN down this path in the first place.
