PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a great LOCATION_1 actor. PRONOUN has a very convincing LOCATION_2 accent. I love the fact that PRONOUN keeps the accent throughout the interviews depending on the role PRONOUN is doing at that time. PRONOUN is NUMERIC_1 of the best actors to quickly gain and lose weight according to the role such as the mechanic where PRONOUN was extremely skinny and pushed health limits. PRONOUN also had to gain extreme weight in the movie vice, PRONOUN was almost unrecognisable . PRONOUN is the best OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 in my opinion. PRONOUN and heath ledger both raised the acting bar very high in the nolans OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 movie. PRONOUN also experienced some health issues during PRONOUN roles in NUMERIC_1 of the action movies, which made PRONOUN shout and lose temper. PRONOUN is also a great husband and father.
