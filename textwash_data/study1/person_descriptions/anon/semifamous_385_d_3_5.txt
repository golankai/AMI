PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was born in DATE_1 and was an LOCATION_1 entrepreneur who had an amazing idea: adding flavouring to medicines to make them easier to take! PRONOUN created a company called ORGANIZATION_1, based in LOCATION_2, that supplied sugar-free, non allergenic and inert medicine flavourings and flavoring systems to pharmacies. The idea of adding flavourings to medicines came to PRONOUN mind when PRONOUN youngest daughter began suffering epileptic seizures when still a baby and refused to take ill-tasting medicines. PRONOUN then developed proper flavourings that PRONOUN little daughter liked and PRONOUN invention was so great that was discovered by the nearby hospitals and made PRONOUN famous.
