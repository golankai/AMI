This guy always looks to me like a guy who really didn't care what people think of PRONOUN. PRONOUN never seems to dress up its a bit like 'take me for what I am ' attitude which I kinda like and get. PRONOUN has just had PRONOUN first child and I think this child will grow up in a relaxed home with lots of love. I also think PRONOUN will most certainly be a hands on dad, when PRONOUN is at home. PRONOUN certainly has a funny side to PRONOUN as I can remember the cameo role PRONOUN had in PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 the third film. In this PRONOUN meets PRONOUN friend at a concert and they get to roll down a hill in NUMERIC_1 of those large plastic balls that people can run, I could imagine that they had a lot of fun filming that !!!! PRONOUN music has always been well received in the music industry and PRONOUN has won quite a few awards from OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 to best sole artist and LOCATION_2 breakthrough act. PRONOUN also proved PRONOUN worth by having NUMERIC_2 solo hits in the LOCATION_4 both together at the same time. In total PRONOUN has sold NUMERIC_8 million records worldwide which makes PRONOUN on of the world's famous selling music artists, not only that but PRONOUN has NUMERIC_9 NUMERIC_1 million RIAA certified unit in the LOCATION_1. Not only those prestige titles but NUMERIC_2 of PRONOUN albums are in the list of the best selling albums in the LOCATION_3 chart history reaching NUMERIC_3 and NUMERIC_4. To be honest this guy has worked hard and achieved great heights you could write pages and pages of stuff but in DATE_1 PRONOUN was officially named artist of the decade by ORGANIZATION_1 with the most .combined success in the LOCATION_3 album and singles charts in the DATE_3's. Then to top it all PRONOUN tour in DATE_4 became the highest grossing of all time in DATE_2.
