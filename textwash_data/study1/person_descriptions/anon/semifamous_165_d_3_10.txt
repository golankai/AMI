PERSON_LASTNAME_1 struggled in PRONOUN early baseball career to be taken seriously. Coming from the LOCATION_2 PRONOUN wanted to represent the people that PRONOUN felt most at ease with - but early DATE_1's LOCATION_1 was not a kind place for people from that part of the world. 
PERSON_LASTNAME_1 worked hard to establish PRONOUN as a player and not a novelty. PRONOUN first met PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 in DATE_2 and was horrified to see that the ORGANIZATION_1 had such membership. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 hated all black people and made sure that PRONOUN overweight child, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2, also felt the same. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was in a public bathroom in LOCATION_3 when PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, aged NUMERIC_1 was struggling to lift PRONOUN off the toilet bowl - PRONOUN over-hanging stomach had wedged PRONOUN into position. PERSON_LASTNAME_1, pried the fat toddler out of the toilet water and rinsed some of the faeces from PERSON_LASTNAME_2's lower legs. PERSON_LASTNAME_2 cried continously as the kind black man helped PRONOUN, and PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was hopeful that this small encounter might have shaped the way that PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 viewed people of colour. Sadly, it didn't and PERSON_LASTNAME_1 would have been horrified to see the state of the Country PRONOUN called home for so many happy years under the presidency of such an incompetent, narcissitic, man-baby with tiny hands and a misshappen genital area.
