From an early age, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was destined to practice law and be in government in some way. PRONOUN was very studious and had a knack of learning that was way above that of PRONOUN friends. 
Whilst PRONOUN was studying PRONOUN was always able to help other people less fortunate than PRONOUN.
Thought it PRONOUN time in politics PRONOUN main interest was to ensure help for the needy, with housing and food parcels. PRONOUN was always looking for other well off friends and colleagues to help out in any way that they were able, providing cheap housing and jobs.
