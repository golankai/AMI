Someone who was embroiled in a sex scandal in the DATE_1. PRONOUN has starred in a number of romantic films which has led to PRONOUN being fairly typecast. PRONOUN recently starred in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 film which felt like a bit of a money grab exercise. PRONOUN dalliance into politics has been viewed cynically given PRONOUN earlier sex scandal. PRONOUN is a white male, dark hair, well spoken. PRONOUN is famous both here in the LOCATION_1 and the LOCATION_2. I would estimate PRONOUN age to be in the mid to late NUMERIC_2s and at NUMERIC_1 point PRONOUN grew a goatee. My favourite film that I saw PRONOUN in was the gentlemen, where PRONOUN adopted a OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 accent. I don't have positive feeling for PRONOUN as PRONOUN comes across as quite arrogant and entitled, however this isn't an opinion I share widely as PRONOUN isn't a relevant topic of conversation amongst my peer group.
