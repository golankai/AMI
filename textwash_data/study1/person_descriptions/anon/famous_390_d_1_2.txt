When I think of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 the first word that comes to mind is ginger. PRONOUN has an almost round face, surrounded by ginger hair and beard. PRONOUN is an amazingly successful singer/songwriter. I find PRONOUN songs quite dull although I suppose they are very catchy. PRONOUN performs live using a loop machine that instantly records and plays back PRONOUN melodies. That way PRONOUN can layer up the backing of each song. Clever, so PRONOUN doesn’t even have to pay a backing band. But I also think it makes watching PRONOUN live a bit boring, as it’s all PRONOUN. PRONOUN got married quite recently and PRONOUN has become a father to a daughter named PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN lives in a huge chunk of LOCATION_1 and on PRONOUN land PRONOUN has even built PRONOUN own pub. When PRONOUN appears on chat shows and the like, PRONOUN always comes across as a very nice bloke.
