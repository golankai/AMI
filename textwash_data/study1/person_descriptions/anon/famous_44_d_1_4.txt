Fun and loving character. I believe PRONOUN music is inspired by PRONOUN quirky lifestyle and is reach ofor deep emotions. I love PRONOUN determination to succeed life barriers specifically within PRONOUN industry. I love PRONOUN love for PRONOUN family - especially PRONOUN mother and later in life for PRONOUN partner and son. A truly inspiring person full of life and ambitions which have driven my own motivation to do big and better things in the past. I was very taken aback by PRONOUN determination to write the song for OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1's funeral which helped tremendously during that difficult time for the whole country. I began following PRONOUN career and life ever since that period as I thought PRONOUN was really courageous and brave to put PRONOUN in such delicate situation.
