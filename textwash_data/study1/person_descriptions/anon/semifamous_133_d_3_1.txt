PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 was a man who was born and died in LOCATION_1, PRONOUN also spent time in LOCATION_2, PRONOUN was really clever, studying law in both places and taking high positions in law and politics. PRONOUN is a distant relative of PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and had siblings. PRONOUN had curly hair and was handsome. PRONOUN was ambitious and wealthy for a man of PRONOUN time. PRONOUN worked hard for the legal system and so I imagine PRONOUN enjoyed PRONOUN down time, drinking whisky and singing and dancing as well as enjoying walking and outdoor pursuits. PRONOUN had a nice accent and spoke beautifully. People of LOCATION_1 respect PRONOUN work and PRONOUN has a life that would attract interest.
