A rather well-spoken, quite tall, deceptively thin quintessentially LOCATION_1' actor whom has found fame on the stage, repertoire, small screen, large screen and LOCATION_2 fame, most notably as an on-screen all-round bad guy in NUMERIC_1 of the many, often utterly confusing and impenetrably overly-complicated OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 franchise films. PRONOUN accent is evolved as are PRONOUN mannerisms on and off screen. PRONOUN is not known for PRONOUN political views but has commented occasionally upon issues as diverse as equal pay and under-represented groups in LOCATION_2 and beyond. PRONOUN was feted as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2, NUMERIC_1 of the ORGANIZATION_1's most successful exports, bringing in much needed foreign-exchange at a time when this country is led by donkeys with I.Q. of the vaccum of space and the morality and mores of some of histories' most evil tyrants. PRONOUN skin is as white as the driven snow, PRONOUN voice as silky as a sow's ear, PRONOUN eyes as penetrating as a psychologist on OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and PRONOUN hair as unruly as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3's after an all night sex and drugs party. PRONOUN dress sense is eclectic; bohemian sheik NUMERIC_1 day, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 cyclist the next - but tweeds and corduroy's are never far from PRONOUN vestibule cupboard.
