PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a proffesional actor from the LOCATION_2. PRONOUN has dark hair which is long for a male and a pale skin tone. PRONOUN is probably best known for PRONOUN role in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 movie inwich PRONOUN plays OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1.
 PRONOUN also played the main character PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 in the movie OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4. PRONOUN has received many awards for PRONOUN works including an Academy award and a Critics choice movie award for best actor.
 PRONOUN has been quoted to say 'I love OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2' from this we can draw the conclusion that PRONOUN likes to eat OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2.

PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is now nearly NUMERIC_1 years of age and has retired from PRONOUN role as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1.

This means PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 was born in DATE_1 in LOCATION_3. To be completely honest I know not much else about PRONOUN and I do not have the time to research because we were only given NUMERIC_5 minutes to complete the task and I still need to write NUMERIC_1 more profiles.

I assume PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 acted in lots of other movies and maybe some TV shows but I would not know becaue I have not seen them. If I had more time I would be able to deliver more factual information. 
 PRONOUN was educated in LOCATION_1 which is surprising because honestly I cant imagine many actors or people in creative arts are educated in LOCATION_1. Or maybe im wrong and LOCATION_1 is actually the global hub of acting. Or not.

Apparently PRONOUN zodiac sign is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3. Which is a fact I doubt even PRONOUN knows because zodiac signs are stupid and I doubt an actor as famous and busy as PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has time to worry about things like that.
 PRONOUN probably has a lot of money because PRONOUN has played prominent roles in so many movies. PRONOUN has spent PRONOUN money on things like food, cars and houses. Amongst other things I assume.

Apparently PERSON_LASTNAME_1 scored PRONOUN first role in a commercial at the age of NUMERIC_2 which is impressive because at that age I hadn't even gotten my pen license.
