PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 likes PRONOUN coffee strong and bitter. No sugar added, because diabetes runs in PRONOUN family, and at PRONOUN age, PRONOUN doesn't want to risk it. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 met PRONOUN husband, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, during a singles party. They were both dragged there unwillingly by friends who did not want to go to the single party alone. They hit it off when they realized that they were the only ones standing by the bar looking extremely bored, and enjoyed a shared interest in how lame the entire idea was. PRONOUN days consist of dreaming of PRONOUN upcoming retirement with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, as they decided on buying a holiday house in LOCATION_1 together - and trying to ignore the clearly jealous employee who's trying PRONOUN best to ensure PRONOUN takes over PRONOUN job once PRONOUN's retired.
