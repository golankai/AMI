PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has been working in sales PRONOUN entire life. When PRONOUN first started in the DATE_1, it was a heavily male dominated workplace and PRONOUN had to gradually work PRONOUN way up from being a secretary to a respected executive. While PRONOUN had some personal life trouble early on, including losing a baby that PRONOUN had with a coworker, the guidance of PRONOUN boss at the firm allowed PRONOUN to thrive and eventually settle down to a mixture of both a career woman and as NUMERIC_1 half of a happily married couple, though PRONOUN did not have any more children. Despite PRONOUN age and relative wealth, PRONOUN continues to work in sales as it is PRONOUN passion. Recently, PRONOUN underwent ankle surgery for a torn ligament injury but continues to go into the office on crutches, showcasing PRONOUN everlasting fighting spirit.
