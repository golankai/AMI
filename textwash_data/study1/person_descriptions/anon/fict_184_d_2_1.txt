PERSON_LASTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 DATE_1 be educated but whenever PRONOUN steps outside of LOCATION_1 PRONOUN is tormented by having to explain how to pronounce or spell PRONOUN name. Despite accomplishing becoming a doctor, the otherwise reasonably cheery PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is burdened with having never made it to the heights PRONOUN education demanded. Museums do not pay much, leaving the good doctor to dress in shirts and trousers that are somewhat looser fitting since PRONOUN took up jogging because it was a free activity. Being a Museum Educational OCCUPATION_1 is a steady wage but it has left PERSON_LASTNAME_1 with a complexion of a man who knows PRONOUN should have done better. Though PRONOUN eyes still shine with admirable enthusiasm for educating children, the slightly greying and receding hair beyond PRONOUN years are wounds of a stress filled battle to make into the educational big time--a lengthy tenured university career filled with international conferences, book writing and lectures about what PRONOUN found most interesting. Life is far from bad, however. A charming smile emanates from the knowledge PRONOUN is providing for PRONOUN lovely wife and children. And in the end, that is all PRONOUN really wants.
