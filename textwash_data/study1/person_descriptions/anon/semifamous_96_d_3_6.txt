PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is an ex OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 Cricketer. Supposedley PRONOUN was born in ORGANIZATION_1 but that is a topic of controversy. Because some would say LOCATION_1 is not a part of ORGANIZATION_1. But that is a discussion for another day.

The surname PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is of Anglo-Saxon origin and was given to a family when they lived near a stony hill. Which is perhaps the weirdest reason to give someone a name. It is unknown whether PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PRONOUN lives near a stony hill.
 PRONOUN was right handed alongside an estimated NUMERIC_6 NUMERIC_5 percent of the population. In this case being in the majority isnt considered an advantage because lots of left sided athletes have an edge over their right sided counterparts.
 PRONOUN represented the county of ORGANIZATION_1 over NUMERIC_1 times which is more than NUMERIC_4 NUMERIC_4. Thats quite a lot by my calculations. 

PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 also captained ORGANIZATION_1 at points which is pretty impressive.
What PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 is doing nowadays is unknown but now aged at NUMERIC_2 I doubt its Cricket.
