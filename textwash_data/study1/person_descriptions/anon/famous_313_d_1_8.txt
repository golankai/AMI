PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 full name PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a famous actor born in the LOCATION_1, PRONOUN mum was a circus performer and PRONOUN dad was a Pilot. PRONOUN is probably best known for playing OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, PRONOUN also played PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5, in my opinion an underrated performance.
For me PRONOUN best roll was in the film of the DATE_1 OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_7 crash the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 PRONOUN plays PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 a pretty strange unsocial guy who finds a huge gap in tye market shorting the mortfage market and the funds that they were built into. PRONOUN has a unique voice and recently voiced PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 film OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_6 of the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 PRONOUN is a great actor with huge appeal.
