PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 full name being PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 was an LOCATION_1 entrepreneur who is best known for being the founder of ORGANIZATION_2 which is a private company based in Columbia, Maryland, LOCATION_3. This is a company that offers medicines of NUMERIC_1 paediatric flavours and NUMERIC_9 veterinary flavours and can apparently be found in NUMERIC_7 NUMERIC_6 + pharmacies in the LOCATION_3.
PERSON_LASTNAME_1 designed medication to be more palatable for consumption by taking away the bitterness adding sweetness and enhancing the flavour profile of the medicine.
In PERSON_LASTNAME_3 early days PERSON_LASTNAME_1's youngest daughter began suffering epileptic seizures weeks after PRONOUN birth in DATE_5. Once PRONOUN was able to be released from the hospital, PRONOUN balked at the multiple daily doses of phenobarbital needed to prevent grand mal seizures, by either refusing to take the ill-tasting medicine or holding it in PRONOUN mouth until it leaked out. PRONOUN seizures continued, resulting in more hospital trips. Within a few months, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and PRONOUN wife PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 decided something had to be done.
In DATE_2, PERSON_LASTNAME_1's father, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4, suggested sweetening the medicine with flavourings used by candy manufacturers. The men spent their evenings, after store hours, tasting different samples. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 then took home the flavoured medicine that PRONOUN hoped PRONOUN daughter would approve. PRONOUN ultimately picked NUMERIC_1 and resumed PRONOUN proper dosage. Parents from the nearby children's hospital heard about the flavouring and ORGANIZATION_2 went into business soon after. PRONOUN graduated from the ORGANIZATION_1 in DATE_4 with a degree in advertising design but developed a dislike for that role which led to a career in medicine
 PRONOUN contracted an infection that resulted in sepsis and cardiac arrest, said PRONOUN wife, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1.......this was in DATE_1 and PRONOUN died at the age of NUMERIC_2 years

The son of a pharmacist, MR/MS. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 grew up working at PRONOUN familyâ€™s business, ORGANIZATION_3 in the LOCATION_5 neighbourhood of LOCATION_4. PRONOUN had joined the operation as a business manager by DATE_3, when PRONOUN and PRONOUN wife had their second daughter, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3.
