TITLE. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 works at ORGANIZATION_1 in LOCATION_2 which was founded over a century ago. PRONOUN is very short sighted and a slightly built figure who seems to stoop over somewhat if you observe PRONOUN closely. Although PRONOUN is not a 'confirmed bachelor' PRONOUN has to date not had much success with PRONOUN personal love life, due in no small part to PRONOUN obsession with all things ancient especially the crumbling remains of both humans and animals. Life can be hard in some LOCATION_1 for men like PRONOUN who although heterosaxual are considered 'different' because they either don't want to have a family or are unable to find a suitable partner, and PRONOUN has been accused of being 'abnormal' although PRONOUN has never had any same sex fantasies but simply cannot 'get it together' with a woman who will accept PRONOUN for who PRONOUN is and ideally share PRONOUN interests which are limited in their scope.
