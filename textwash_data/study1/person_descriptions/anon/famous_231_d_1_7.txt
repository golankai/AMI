Former actor, dark hair, maybe wears glasses, PRONOUN's recently recently made the news for having aligned with the batshit crazy trans lobby. NUMERIC_4 characters eh? PRONOUN's only played OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 to the best of my knowledge. There's a flying car in it. And the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3 features too. If you're going to look a that viaduct with the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 passing over, get there in plenty of time as there are a lot of oriental tourists wanting a look too. PRONOUN got put into hogwarts by the sorting hat. There's a name you shouldn't say too, like PERSON_LASTNAME_1. Probably best not to suggest that women don't have penises around PRONOUN either.
