PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 has been in a relationship with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and is planning to propose on christmas which is only so many months away. PRONOUN has already picked out the ring, and planned the speech now all thats left is for sarah to say yes. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 didn't always want to be a consulting civil engineer, PRONOUN wanted to be an olympic athlete when PRONOUN was a child but due to an injury when PRONOUN was NUMERIC_3 PRONOUN was never able to follow through with the dream. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has always wanted to be a father and both PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 and PRONOUN have discussed having children but they habe decided they would much rather adopt than have a biological child as PERSON_LASTNAME_1 PRONOUN was adopted. PERSON_LASTNAME_1's biological parents were unable to take care of PERSON_LASTNAME_1 so PRONOUN was taken out of their care and placed into fostercare at the age of NUMERIC_1. PRONOUN was then passed from foster placement to foster placement until PRONOUN finally went to live with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 when PRONOUN was NUMERIC_2. They fell in love with PRONOUN even though they had already had NUMERIC_1 of their own biological children but they proceeded to adopt PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and still love PRONOUN as their own to this day.
