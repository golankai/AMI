The person we are going to talk about today is the doctor PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1, PRONOUN currently resides in LOCATION_2 but PRONOUN surname suggests that PRONOUN might have LOCATION_1 origin. PRONOUN works as a hydrograohic surveyor and PRONOUN's currently in a romantic relationship, both of these facts could be the reason why PRONOUN is living in LOCATION_2, maybe PRONOUN went there to follow PRONOUN carreer, or maybe PRONOUN went there to follow love. At the time PRONOUN is NUMERIC_2 years old so PRONOUN's gonna probably retire soon, maybe PRONOUN will stay there or maybe PRONOUN will relocate somewhere else, we don't have any information about PRONOUN partner, PRONOUN PRONOUN could be much younger then PRONOUN and still be working, or maybe already retired as well.
