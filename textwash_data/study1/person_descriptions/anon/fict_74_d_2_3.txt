PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is a long scar next to PRONOUN right eye and often wears only black because at the weekends PRONOUN impersonate PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. Sometimes people PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 but PRONOUN's not OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 PRONOUN is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. It does come with some benefits though PRONOUN sometimes gets free meals and upgrades on flights. Last year PRONOUN even got tickets with a plus NUMERIC_1 (because PRONOUN's in a relationship) the OCCUPATION_1 of OCCUPATION_2 (they thought PRONOUN was PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1. PRONOUN has brown hair and dark eyes, a thin nose which is quite long. From time to time PRONOUN argues with PRONOUN wife because PRONOUN doesn't like PRONOUN wearing capes and saying ""I'm OCCUPATION_2"". PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 needs help designing so hasan is working as PRONOUN civil engineer for free to learn PRONOUN mannerisms.
