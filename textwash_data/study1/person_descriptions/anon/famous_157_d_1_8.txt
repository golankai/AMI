PRONOUN is a very famous actor in LOCATION_2 who played batman. PRONOUN's very accomplished person and has a unique way of carrying PRONOUN. I think PRONOUN has played a drug addict in the past as well. PRONOUN has also played the lead in various other films such as terminator, the big short, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 psycho. I would say PRONOUN is quite attractive too!! OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 I thought PRONOUN was LOCATION_1 but I think PRONOUN is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. PRONOUN is around NUMERIC_2 years old...maybe slightly older? PRONOUN has dark hair and is Caucasian. I would be surprised if PRONOUN name was a stage name as it sounds quite authentic. PRONOUN put on a huskies voice than PRONOUN own in batman and I believe PRONOUN did many of PRONOUN own stunts in the films.
