PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 is a LOCATION_2 actor who typically plays awkward, posh, unmistakably LOCATION_1 characters. While PRONOUN has PRONOUN charms, a varied set of acting skills is not chief among them and PRONOUN movie roles in particular seem to be various versions of, if not PRONOUN, then the same character PRONOUN played in OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. PRONOUN recent TV series, a very OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, highlight PRONOUN ability to perform well in other roles.

When PRONOUN first become well known, PRONOUN career has been somewhat overshadowed by PRONOUN personal life e.g. PRONOUN relationship with the glamourous PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and PRONOUN liaison with the prostitute PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 but seemed to be cast in the role of archetypal footloose and fancy-free bachelor. Unlike PRONOUN characters, this seemed to be a perpetual state of affairs.

To the public, PRONOUN introduction to fatherhood seemed to typify this. Later in life than average and within an unfathomable timeline, PRONOUN involvement with NUMERIC_1 women has resulted in the birth of NUMERIC_2 children. However, does seem to have finally settled down and embraced PRONOUN role as a father and partner.
 PRONOUN recent appearances in the media appear to relate less to PRONOUN career and personal life and more to the fight against invasion of privacy by the media, notably over the phone hacking scandal involving the News of the world.
