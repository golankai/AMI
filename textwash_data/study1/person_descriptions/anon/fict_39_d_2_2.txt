What is a hydrographic surveyor? PRONOUN name is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1'conner. It is soooooooo hard to describe someone who is nonexistent. If I don't know anything, how can I describe OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1'conner? 
 
 Is OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1'conner in a relationship with a man or a woman or something different like a dog? I think I met a man with the same or different name on a maybe nonexistent planet in a parallel universe. In my view, I think that PRONOUN has some family members and a singular friend and a relation with a cardboard box.
