British actor.
 PRONOUN is best known for PRONOUN roles in rom coms. PRONOUN used to be quite funny. Not so sure anymore. PRONOUN was in Love actually, OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and several other well known movies. 
 PRONOUN was in another movie with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 that I can't remember the name of, NUMERIC_1 months I think? 
 PRONOUN in the new movie that I can't remember the name of. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2 I think it is? PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_3. I've not yet seen it. 

I have absolutely no idea what else to describe about PRONOUN that matches NUMERIC_2 characters, other than the fact PRONOUN's not played NUMERIC_2 characters in movies that is lol. 

I used to enjoy PRONOUN movies. I don't quite think it's for me anymore.

Once you've seen NUMERIC_2 of PRONOUN movies, you've seen them all.

Very ""samey"".
