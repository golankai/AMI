PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2. 
 PRONOUN is a LOCATION_1 footballer who plays for ORGANIZATION_2. PRONOUN plays as a left winger. 
 PRONOUN is thirty years old currently, and was born DATE_1 NUMERIC_4th, NUMERIC_2. 
 PRONOUN is capable of playing on the right side as well, albeit not quite as efficiently.

I have to be honest, I tend to know a lot about football, but I have never heard of this guy.

It actually looks like PRONOUN is in fact a free agent and without a club at the moment. I suppose my initial statement that PRONOUN has a club is incorrect. 

I get the feeling that PRONOUN does not bend it like ORGANIZATION_1. Perhaps though, PRONOUN lobs it like PERSON_LASTNAME_1.
