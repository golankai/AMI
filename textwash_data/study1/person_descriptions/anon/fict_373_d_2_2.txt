OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 O'conner came to my attention when it was reported in a LOCATION_1 newspaper that a LOCATION_1 man who had been living in LOCATION_3 had been arrested by the LOCATION_4 police service. The LOCATION_2 said that OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 O,connor was not a hydrographic surveyor as PRONOUN stated when interviewed but in fact a LOCATION_1 spy. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 O'connor's patner PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_6 said the whole thing was very upsetting as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 O'connor, age NUMERIC_1, suffered from nose bleeds when in a stressful situation and MR/MS PERSON_LASTNAME_6 was very concerned for OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 O'connors health. MR/MS PERSON_LASTNAME_5 also added that PERSON_LASTNAME_1 would never dream of spying on another country and all these allegations from the LOCATION_2 was rubbish. The LOCATION_1 consulate said they would look into the matter but did not have high hopes.
