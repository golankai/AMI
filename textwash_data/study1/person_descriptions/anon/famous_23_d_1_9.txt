PRONOUN is an actor who grew up in LOCATION_2, PRONOUN went to school in LOCATION_3 and used to live in the LOCATION_1 area. PRONOUN was in a movie with PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 called OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1 and in another titled About A boy, that's all I know about PRONOUN, I'm not a fan. People say PRONOUN's not very nice when you meet PRONOUN person, I wouldn't know as I have never met PRONOUN lol. I don't know what else to add to be honest, I have never been interested in PRONOUN or PRONOUN carreer to be honest so I really have no much knowledge about PRONOUN. PRONOUN has blue eyes and brown hair, even though now they are probably grey because of age, I think by now PRONOUN is over NUMERIC_2 years old.
