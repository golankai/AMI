PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 (June NUMERIC_7, NUMERIC_2 â€“ DATE_1 NUMERIC_6, NUMERIC_1) was an LOCATION_2 entrepreneur who founded ORGANIZATION_2 and its system of adding flavoring to otherwise unpalatable medicines to make them easier to take. NUMERIC_4] NUMERIC_5] NUMERIC_9]

PERSON_LASTNAME_1 was born in LOCATION_1, D.C. and grew up in Potomac, Maryland. PRONOUN graduated from the ORGANIZATION_1 in DATE_4 with a degree in advertising design and became an art director for an agency. After developing a dislike for that career in DATE_3, PRONOUN joined PRONOUN father's pharmacy firm in LOCATION_1 as a business manager. PERSON_LASTNAME_1's youngest daughter began suffering epileptic seizures weeks after PRONOUN birth in DATE_5. Once PRONOUN was able to be released from the hospital, PRONOUN balked at the multiple daily doses of phenobarbital needed to prevent grand mal seizures, by either refusing to take the ill-tasting medicine or holding it in PRONOUN mouth until it leaked out. PRONOUN seizures continued, resulting in more hospital trips. Within a few months, PERSON_LASTNAME_1 and PRONOUN wife PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 decided something must be done. NUMERIC_8]

In DATE_2 DATE_3, PERSON_LASTNAME_1's father, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3, suggested sweetening the medicine with flavorings used by candy manufacturers. The men spent their evenings, after store hours, tasting different samples. PERSON_LASTNAME_1 then took home the flavored medicine that PRONOUN hoped PRONOUN daughter would approve. PRONOUN ultimately picked NUMERIC_1 and resumed PRONOUN proper dosage. Parents from the nearby children's hospital heard about the flavoring, and ORGANIZATION_2 went into business.
