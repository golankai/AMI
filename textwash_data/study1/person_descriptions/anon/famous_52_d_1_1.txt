PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 is a world-renowned LOCATION_1 actor who was born in London, England in DATE_1. PRONOUN career has seen PRONOUN develop from a TV actor into a LOCATION_3 leading man. PRONOUN has played a variety of roles from critically acclaimed movies such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, NUMERIC_4 Years a Slave, through to voice over work on OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_1. PRONOUN is most recognisable for PRONOUN portrayal as OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_4 or OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_3. OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_5 in the OTHER_IDENTIFYING_ATTRIBUTE_2. 
PERSON_LASTNAME_1 has also tread the boards of theatre world on more than NUMERIC_1 occasion.
I would describe PRONOUN as a fairly straight-laced actor and it is DATE_1 be a reflection of PRONOUN or the roles that PRONOUN plays but the characters come across as rather emotionless or boring.
That said I have enjoyed a number of PRONOUN movies but sometimes NUMERIC_1 has to be in the mood to sit down and watch NUMERIC_1 of PRONOUN more serious portrayals.
