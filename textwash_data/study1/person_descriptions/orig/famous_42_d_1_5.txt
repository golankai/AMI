He was a seventies Rock star and still is an amazing musician. Fashion icon in his day and women found him extremely attractive. He was the front man for the Rolling Stones and i believe he wrote a lot of their songs. He has had numerous records and been a very successful artist. 
He has eight children with five different women and he had his last child i think when he was 73.  He also has grandchildren and great grandchildren. 
I don't know what else to write unless you want me to copy out his entry in wikipedia? I don't know anymore about him other than he was a musician in the 70's and a very famous person for his singing and his struting about on stage.
