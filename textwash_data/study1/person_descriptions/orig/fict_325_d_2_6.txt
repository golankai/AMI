The name of the person i am describing is called rinda chuster, this name can be either male of female. it is not very clear. but i think, this person is a female woman. the job of this person works in sales as a sales excutive. the age of this person is 69. they should be retiring soon as they should have alreay retired. so maybe this person is a male as they tend to reitre much much later in their lifetime. unlike women who tend to retie early alot more much more earlier than their male counter part. the coutry that this perosn lives in is the uniter kingdom, more specifically they live in the england. but we don't know which city.
