Hasan Daniel is a well known and well respected man in civil engineering. He was born in Canada but moved to the UK when he was 7, there he attended a local grammar school studied hard and then gained a place at a Russel Group University where he studied Civil Engineering. He was part of the University Rugby team and still likes to keep fit. Daniel has just run the London Marathon and plans on the New York marathon next.
Daniel is currently 31 years old and is seeking employment back in Canada as he plans to marry his Canadian girlfriend and make a home in Toronto.
I believe that Daniel would be an excellent candidate for any role in a large or small organisation. He is motivated, organised and a key player. Daniel has managed a team in the past and succeeded in this role. He now is looking for a new challenge and a company where he can begin married life and settle into a new city.
