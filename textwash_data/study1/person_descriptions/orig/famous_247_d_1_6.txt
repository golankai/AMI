beautiful, and amazing singer, iconic singer. lost a lot of weight recently! good for her. i really love her however I think she looked better when she was bigger but she is more healthy now. it shocks me though because she said she never wants to be skinny and that she'd rather be fat and make a better album than be skinny. i know she made a skyfall song that i don't believe she was a part of cultural appropriation because she grew up in Tottenham she seems so much more confident and happy now though.im sure she's won an award, an oscar actually loool. i don't really have much else to say about her except the fact that she gave waaaay too much to her husband in her divorce
