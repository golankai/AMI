Yassine El Ghanassy, born 12th July 1990, is the son of former footballer Hajjaj El Ghanassy. Following in his father’s footsteps, Yassine became interested in the sport at an early age. 

Beginning his football career at the age of 15, Ghanassy was quickly signed by a youth team named Fayt-manage. He was known as a fine passer of the ball and one who assisted his teammates well, even described as a magician by his agent. 

At 5ft8, Ghanassy made a perfect left-winger, which is why he was signed by the youth team of La Louvière. Interest aroused from the likes of Birmingham City, but didn’t end in a deal being signed.

In March 2018, Ghanassy was served a six month prison sentence after being caught speeding for the 15th time, following a reckless driving charge in 2016. This resulted in a driving ban for 2 years.
