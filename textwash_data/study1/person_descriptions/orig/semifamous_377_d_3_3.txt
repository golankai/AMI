Yassine El Ghanassy. 

He is a Belgian footballer who plays for Al Raed FC. He plays as a left winger. 

He is thirty years old currently, and was born June 12th, 1990. 

He is capable of playing on the right side as well, albeit not quite as efficiently.

I have to be honest, I tend to know a lot about football, but I have never heard of this guy.

It actually looks like he is in fact a free agent and without a club at the moment. I suppose my initial statement that he has a club is incorrect. 

I get the feeling that he does not bend it like Beckham. Perhaps though, he lobs it like Ghanassy.
