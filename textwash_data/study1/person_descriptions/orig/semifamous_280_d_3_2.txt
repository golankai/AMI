William P. Bettendorf was an American inventor and industrialist of German ancestry. He was born in Mendota, Illinois, on the 1st of July, 1857. While working as a machinist's apprentice at a company producing plows and agricultural implements, he invented the 'power lift sulky plow', a device enabling a seated farmer to raise his horse driven plow from the earth with the press of a button. He went on to create a number of other useful inventions, and in 1885, with his brother Joseph, he decided to found his own company, the Bettendorf Axle Company. It was originally for agricultural equipment, but grew quickly, and expanded to the production of other machinery, railway boxcars, and even toys. In 1900, they moved their business to the town of Gilbert, which changed its name to Bettendorf in honour of him and his brother. He started the construction of a huge 22-acre estate outside the town, but did not live to see its construction. He died at age 52, on the 3rd of June 1910, and his wife passed away that same year.
