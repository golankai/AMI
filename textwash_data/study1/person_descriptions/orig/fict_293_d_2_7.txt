Liana loves her three children ever since she adopted them from the shelter. For a long time she though Felix, Igor and Drac would be enough to keep her company. 
However, recently, she felt something was missing. After talking to one of her nieces, she decided to give Hinge a try. 
Turns out all the men on there are trash. Just like this Alex who did not show up to their date. So here she is, sitting at the bar, salt from her margarita still on her lips, thinking about missing Gone with the Wind on tv. 
Looking around she finally notices her. A brunette, probably 10 years younger than her, sitting at one of the dining tables, looking at Liana, while the man sitting in front of her is completely taken by the content on his phone. 
The woman stands up, walking towards Liana, while the man starts a call.
Liana's phone starts ringing, loudly.

And suddenly Liana wakes up. She once again fell asleep at her desk. The payroll spreadsheet is still live on her screen. The phone is still ringing.
""Hi honey, yes, I will coming home soon.""
Her husband grunts on the other side, before telling her that dinner is in the fridge.
