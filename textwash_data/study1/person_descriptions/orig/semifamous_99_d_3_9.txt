Walter Knaus Chorn played the positions of Guard and Tackle with the Vanderbilt Commodores college football team in 1906. That season the team finished top of their conference and overall with an 8-1-0 record, much of their success being due to Chorn's hard work and team building expertise.

He was selected for the College Football All-Southern Team in 1906 and picked for an all-time Vanderbilt team which was named in 1912.

Chorn left university with a law degree and opened a law office in his home town of Lafayette, Missouri. By 1910 he was working in the state auditor's office and in 1913 he was made chief clerk of the state's supreme court.

Chorn was born in 1885 and passed away in 1933
