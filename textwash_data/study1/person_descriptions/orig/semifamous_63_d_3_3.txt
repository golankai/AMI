Yassine is a Beligian athlete who plays football and is a legacy as his father also played the game. He played for Birmingham City and several other teams but seems not to have found much success anywhere. He has been arrested for reckless driving and is not a very responsible person. He has trouble fitting in with a team and often gets placed on the bench due to poor attitude. He has an unearned sense of entitlement due to his father also being a footballer and can often be seen fighting with the referee and the coaches. He is jealous of other players success and takes this out on his family with whom he is now estranged.
