Lucia Hamill is a recently divorced chief marketing officer for a silicone valley tech giant based in Ireland.

Despite repeated attempts are having children with her husband, despite having no biological impediment, she was unable to conceive.  The devastating news broke her marriage.

Three years on, she is content to find herself in a relationship with her subordinate at work, a 35-year-old personal secretary named Jacob.  

Lucia is privately terrified that the human resources department at her workplace will learn about her illicit relationship with a colleague.  And, notwithstanding the disapproval of her family, she remains increasingly fond of her inamorato.

She was originally born in Limerick in a family with a long-standing association with the abattoir business.  But as she couldn't bring herself to profit from animal suffering, she decided to strike out to the capital.  Once there, she studied economics at university before working her way up the corporate food chain.
