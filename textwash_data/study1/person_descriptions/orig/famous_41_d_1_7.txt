I first remember seeing Daniel Radcliffe in of course - Harry Potter. His acting career was extremely successful, and as a young child I remember being in awe when seeing him on screen, and the adventures he endeavored. He is born and raised in London which makes him more relatable in terms of growing up British. 

Aside from being an actor he is quite inspirational to many young adults across the world. He has previously revealed he has a neurological disorder, and he explained how it affected his ability to sometimes do simple things. By opening up, he has given hope to people, in order to push themselves and pursue their dreams.
