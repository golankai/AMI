Hasan Daniel is a 31 year old man currently based in Toronto, Canada. He lives in an apartment flat with his girlfriend and fourteen cats. He works as a consulting civil engineer to fund his lifelong passion of train watching. In his free time and weekends, he spends his time taking photos of trains and train stations around Ontario for his train watching website, Off the Track. His website is well-known in the international train watching community, mainly because of his photos often feature his pet cats posing in the foreground. Hasan's favourite train model is the Bombardier X43, which was first manufactured in 2004. This train model is mostly used on the Dalloway line, which can be seen from Hasan's flat.
