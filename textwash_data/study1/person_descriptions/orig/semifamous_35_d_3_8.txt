Aleksandr Gryazin is a former professional footballer, hailing from Russia. He made his debut at PFC CSKA-d Moscow in 1992, at the age of 18, where he showed his potential in scoring over 20 goals within 84 appearances with the club.

After spending two years at PFC CSKA-d Moscow, he bounced between teams until he joined FC Saturn Ramenskoye in 1996. He would spend 4 years there, totting up over 140 appearances. However, his goal-scoring potential was in decline, only just managing to beat his record at his first team. From there, his star seemed to wane, only managing a scant few appearances and even fewer goals between various teams. He retired in 2005.
