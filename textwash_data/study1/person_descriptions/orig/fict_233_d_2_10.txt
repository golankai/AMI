Born in 1978 to Dutch and German parents, Amelia Crooks Studied literature at the College of Austrian Books And That. By her third semester she realised that the written word wasnâ€™t her forte and dropped out. After a year travelling the world, and doing everything from selling crabs to Argentine fishermen to dancing naked in the moonlight before African tribespeople (just for fun), Miss Crooks undertook a course in Information Technology at the University of Computerythings, where she excelled and graduated with distinction in 1996. She now teaches at the same university, although rarely demonstrates her dancing skills to her students.
