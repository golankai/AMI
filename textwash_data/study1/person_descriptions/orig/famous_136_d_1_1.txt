Benedict Cumberbatch is a smart and highly intelligent individual. As is clear from his stunnig performance in Sherlock and Doctor Who. He comes across as a well-spoken and put together english man. He is a wealthy and successful that is well known across the country and internationally. He is particular well known in London thanks to his London based role as Sherlock. He is a very simple man who is well-dressed, but dresses in rather imposing dark colours, demanding attention as he walks into the room. He comes across as an intellectual, with less social skills but a very informative and professional demeanour.
