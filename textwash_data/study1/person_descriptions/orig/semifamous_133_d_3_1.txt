Enoch was a man who was born and died in America, he also spent time in Paris, he was really clever, studying law in both places and taking high positions in law and politics. He is a distant relative of Abraham Lincoln and had siblings. He had curly hair and was handsome. He was ambitious and wealthy for a man of his time. He worked hard for the legal system and so I imagine he enjoyed his down time, drinking whisky and singing and dancing as well as enjoying walking and outdoor pursuits. He had a nice accent and spoke beautifully. People of America respect his work and he has a life that would attract interest.
