Dr. Brantley Ratke is slim and stands over 6 foot while sporting horn rimmed glasses. 
He's balding and instead of letting his hair grow naturally he put a razor to his head 2 years ago on his 35th birthday. He has a brown beard, peppered with greys that he oils each day and grooms meticulously. 
Some would say he's handsome and he would have much more attention from the ladies if it wasn't for his stand offish air and the fact he was always reading a book and always giving the impression of ''do not disturb''. 
As its Autumn he sports a shacket that he debated buying for far too long since he thought it was too young for him and a light nautical striped jumper.
