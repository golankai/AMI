Famous to cricket fans, particularly in England. From Cornwall so probably enjoys long beach walks with his family and dog. Played for multiple teams at minor county clubs, not very high level but a good competitor anyway.  Seems like he had a strong personality and was a leader at his level as he captained Cornwall. Probably a very proud man, quite patriotic. Loves the queen and royal family. Bald and quite a red face, probably tells every youngster he meets that he used to play cricket. Made lots of appearances so probably quite into fitness and health. Probably quite a wealthy man who lives a comfortable lifestyle and votes Conservatives.
