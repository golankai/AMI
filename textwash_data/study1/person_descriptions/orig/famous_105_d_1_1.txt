Played sherlock holmes and Dr Strange. Brilliant actor and quite handsome. He is very chiselled. Also very funny. I associate him with a quirky character in a movie or TV show as he has a very distinct way of acting. He isn't conventionally attractive but there is something about his appearance that is very endearing. I think most people would associate him with his character of sherlock holmes or Dr strange. He presents himself very well always wearing a suit and looks dapper a lot of the time. From my understanding, he studied acting for quite a while before he booked his role as Sherlock Holmes, which I think was his first mainstream media gig and what people would recognise him for.
