From humble beginnings, William P.Bettendorf rose to the giddy heights of a world-class inventor with no fewer than 94 patents to his name by the age of 53.  His first job as a company message boy was followed by a stint as a clerk in a hardware store, but it was only when he became an apprentice machinist that he found his true mettle, if you'll pardon the pun.  William was not the only Bettendorf with engineering in his blood; his younger brother Joseph joined him to found the Bettendorf Axle Company.  Such was the regard with which William was held in the community that the city of Bettendorf was named after him.
