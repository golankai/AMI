Hermann Pocacha is a transexual Marketing Executive who lives in Barcelona, Spain. He grew up as ""Valencia"" Pochacha with two brothers and a younger sister but knew he was different from age 4. After attending a strict catholic school, Hermann decided to run away from home at age 15 and start his new life as his honest identity. However, before deciding on the name Hermann he tried four other names before settling. He met his non-binary partner in a tapas bar one night, who goes by the name of Jay. This was back in their twenties and they have spent the last twenty years fighting the oppression and discrimination thrown at LGBT couples in Catholic Spain.
