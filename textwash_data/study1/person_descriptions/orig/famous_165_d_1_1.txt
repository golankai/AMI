He is an actor and a versitile one! He plays a wide range of roles and can be equally at home playing the hero or a villain.
He is a well spoken and eloquent man and posesses a real 'aristocratic' air. 
He is a handsome and smartly dressed man. He is popular around the world and has performed in films and on stage. He seems to have a good sense of humour and his co-stars seem to like him.
Some of his more recent roles have been in super-hero movies and although these may be the most economically successful - I feel he is a more serious thespian.
He is English but can perform with a passable American accent.
