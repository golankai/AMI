Christian Bale is a great actor who takes his roles very seriously. Christian Bale is from London however people always thought he was American. He was very creepy in the Machinist and looked very different to what he looks like in real life. He seems like a very humble and relaxed guy when he is not filming however he would be intense when he is filming. Christian Bale was also great in American Psycho, coming off quite attractive for a serial killer. Even though I am not a superhero film fan, Christian Bale made the Batman films very enjoyable. Christian Bale is big supporter of environmental charities.
