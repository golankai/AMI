Irvin comes across as somebody that would have kept himself to himself. Playing sports in the US as a black man playing in the Negro League was tough for him but a way to live a good life so that he could provide for his family. He was incredibly talented at what he did and was known as a big hitter, and could also do a really good job in other positions on the field too. His talent meant he was therefore named in an all time Negro league Baseball team. Irvin died in 1966 and thanks to his career, was able to ensure good futures for his family, in what is a tough place to be a black person (in that time).
