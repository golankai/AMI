Hasan Daniel is was born in Quebec, Canada. Hasan grew up in a small town where his family owned and operated a successful chain of restaurants. The Daniel family came into the spotlight when Hasan won a scholarship to the University of Vancouver which would see him all the way through his 4-year civil engineering degree. This stirred up some ill-feeling in the small town as other who had also applied for the scholarship and where from less affluent families lost out.
Hasan has been in a relationship with the same person since he was 18. They are expected to get married within the next year, but the pressure is getting to them.
