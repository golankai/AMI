Dr Ratke is a valued member of the Uganda Museum and plays an important role as the public face for the museum.
Primarily he is responsible for tours and lectures of all groups that visit the museum; from school groups, to universities, to special interest and the general public. He teaches all groups more about the history of Uganda, not shying away from the terror of Idi Amin and the destruction he wrought on the country. He also clearly shows the different groups, both Ugandan and others who were involved in whipping up hatred towards each other; nor does he spare them their involvement & guilt.
This is vitally important for Ugandans to know as otherwise a blinkered understanding of their own history will lead to a repetition of the recent past. No Ugandan wants this as the country is tires, economically exhausted and wanting to build a peaceful, successful country.

Dr Ratke was born in Uganda. His under-graduate and post-graduate studies were at the University of York UK in their superb Archaeology department.
