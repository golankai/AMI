Dr Brantley Ratke is a wonderfully, extrovert character. He is a very handsome man who wears a three-piece suit all the time. He wears wire framed, round spectacles and has slicked over, side parted hair. He is the object of desire from the museum curator. Dr Ratke moved over to London in his early twenties when he decided to come to study at a London university. He moved back to Sweden recently. He has a love for classical music and he takes his job very seriously. He's a world leader in his position.
To socialise, he like a dark rum and frequents high falutin restaurants with the high society of London and Stockholm.
He is single because he doesn't have time to romance and will never love a woman more than he does his job.
