Hermann Pacocha Jr. is loving life. He is in a happy relationship with the stunning Eva but no way is he going to tie the knot. Why buy the cow when you can have the milk for free! is his motto. He loves his job as a Marketing executive in sunny Barcelona. He often heads to the beach to unwind on the weekend. Sometimes he likes to go out with the lads and they end up in a night club. He likes to dance the night away it makes him feel like he's in his twenties again. But he always goes home to Eva, he is a very loyal partner in spite of his reluctance to settle down. Hermann's parents were divorced and he remembers hearing their blistering rows when he was a little boy. He swore he would never get married and end up just like them.
