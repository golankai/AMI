Brantley Ratke (PhD) is a Museum Educational Officer in Uganda. The 37-year-old man is on the hunt for love after a decade of unsuccessful dates. This jovial, classically handsome man will sweep most people off their feet, especially since he has to supplement his earnings by taking a night job as the cleaner of the same museum in which he is an educational officer.
This additional income is to furnish his gambling and cocaine addictions, both of which have sent Brantley into mountains of debt. There are multiple loansharks with vendettas against him, although the debts were accrued by him under different names and in different cities than the one he now lives.
Brantley is, in fact, not his real name; he is an identity thief. But don't let this put you off dating him. It just means he's versatile and inventive!
