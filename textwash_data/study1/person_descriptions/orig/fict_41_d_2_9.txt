I met Ferd Homenick on a recent trip to Belgium, and at first I was apprehensive to meet him. However, once I introduced myself to him, the conversation was so smooth that I couldn’t see it ending. You see, Homenick, although 53, is so young at heart, he is wiser than most of us, but his banter - oh his banter, is just something else. Ferd makes you feel alive when speaking to him, and quite honestly I still don’t know why he’s single! But to be frank, he is happy with his pets and job as a car dealer, where he earns enough money to live a comfortable life. His hobbies range in a variety of things, as he only works part time. Some days he loves painting, especially Landscapes (the views in Belgium!). But, he also loves keeping fit and healthy, so he undertakes several sports too, such as cycling and running. Hopefully, when you visit Belgium you can meet Ferd and see just how great he is!
