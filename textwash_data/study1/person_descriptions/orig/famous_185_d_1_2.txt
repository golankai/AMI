A musician with ginger hair and famous for creating heartfelt lover songs. He used to be criticised for his looks but overtime his music made up for it and people decided to stop saying horrible things about him. He is kindhearted and unproblematic as a celebrity. Now married since 2018, he is happy, rich yet humble. 

He is from the UK, originally from Yorkshire and choir member of a church from a very young age, his musical talents were recognised and cultivated since at least the age of 4. Being British made him even more sought after once making it into the public eye as Americans have a thing for British accents and British talent somewhat.
