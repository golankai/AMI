Kenneth Kramm was born in 1961 in Washington DC but grew up in Potomac, Maryland. He started working for his father's firm in Washington in 1992. Before that he has studied Adverstising Design at the University in Maryland and worked as an art director but disliked this kind of work. His daughter suffered with epileptic seizures when She was only be few weeks old and has to take several doses of a foul tasting medication to prevent her seizures but either refused to take it or spat it out resulting in more trips to the hospital. Kramm's father suggested sweetening the medication to make it palatable and the two men sampled lots of flavours from various candies until she found one she liked and this worked. With some word of mouth Kramm created the company FLAVORx. Kramm died in 2016 following a sepsis infection.
