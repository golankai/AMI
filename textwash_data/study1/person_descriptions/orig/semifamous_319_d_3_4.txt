Clyde fernandes is a semi famous football celebrity. Although he is not as well known as some of the bigger names in football such as leo nel messi or crisitiano ronaldo, he is in Indias I-League 2nd Division. His official dbut lasted 59 minutes as his team drew 0-0 with his opnonents, In terms of official international games, he played south africa with inidias under 16s. Unfortunately in the 7 appearances he has made he has never scored a goal which has lead many to question if he was even good enough to call himself a footballer, nevermind a player in Indias 3rd best league. Clyde is still actively playing football so we can hope that his career sees a bit more light because so far the only thing that can be seen at the end of the tunnel that is his football career is darkness.
