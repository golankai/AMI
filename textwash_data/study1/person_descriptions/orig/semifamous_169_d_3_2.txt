He is an inventor from Illinois, born in 1857 to a German father and American mother. Known for various innovations and patents, his works were very influential in the early industrial development of the United States. Most of his products were agricultural instruments, gears and wheels. Together with his brother Joseph, the two formed a company in 1895. He was the first president and his brother the first secretary. The plant they built closed in 1932, heavily effected by the Great Depression, but the building still stands and is the site of a casino. He has a city named after him in east Iowa.
