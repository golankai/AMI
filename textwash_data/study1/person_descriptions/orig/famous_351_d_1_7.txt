Born in 1989, Daniel Radcliffe, an English actor from London, UK, is best known for his portrayal of the young prodigal wizard, Harry Potter, a book series originally created by J.K. Rowling. With a net worth of over $110 million dollars, Radcliffe has been featured in a vast array of films, including The Woman in Black, Horns and Swiss Army Man. Radcliffe's closest friend's consist of those from the Harry Potter cast - Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), which is rather surprising as both Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are mortal enemies in the series.

Not many people know this about Daniel Radcliffe, but he actually suffers from a mild form of dyspraxia; a condition that affects physical coordination.
