Kenneth Lee Kramm was born on July sixteenth nineteen sixty one in Washington DC. He was an American entrepreneur who started FLAVORx and the system of adding flavoring to medicines to make them easier for people to take. May 1992, Kramm's father, Harold, suggested sweetening the medicine with flavorings used by candy manufacturers. The men spent their evenings, after store hours, tasting different samples. It was his daughter who gave him the idea for it as she had epileptic seizures weeks after her birth in nineteen ninety two. He grew up in Maryland. He died in two thousand and sixteen from sepsis.
