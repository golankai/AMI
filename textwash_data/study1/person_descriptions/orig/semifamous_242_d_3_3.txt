Yassine El Ghanassy is a Belgian born footballer who was eligible to represent Belgium and Morocco at international football. 
He was highly rated as a youngster which led to trials in England with birmingham city football club. Unfortunately this move didn't materialise due to his team requesting too much money for a transfer. This led to him moving to Gent where he has a relative amount of success, although only one honour. He was known for his close dribbling skills and wide range of passing. His team mates were the benefactors of his passing as he assisted many goals. He represented Belgium. 
El Ghanassy was a single child.
