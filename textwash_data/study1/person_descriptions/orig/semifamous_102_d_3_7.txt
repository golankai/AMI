Charles Lund Black Jr. was an American man born in 1915, who became semi-famous due to his large role in abolishing school segregation, due to his part in a court-ruled decision in 1954 which stated that the state laws that surrounded racial segregation in American schools at the time were not constitutional, which up until that point was common-place among the various schools in the country, such as the event that sparked the debate in the first place; a young daughter of a black resident was refused entry into the closest school to their home, instead requiring her to go to one further away.
