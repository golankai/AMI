Irvin Brooks (full name, Irvin Woodberry ""Chester"" Brooks) was born on June 5, 1891 and died 79 years later on February 4, 1966. He was a black American and played baseball for Brooklyn Royal Giants for the whole of his career. BRG competed in the Negro leagues – those leagues comprising African American and Latin American teams. He was not born in the Bahamas as some references detail, but in Key West, Florida, in the southern part of the US. He was nicknamed ‘Chester’ to indicate his West Indian origins. His successful career lasted between 1918 and 1933, 25 years of competitive sport. He played pitcher, infielder and outfielder during those campaigns. Evidently, he was a very accomplished player, being placed by Cumberland Posey (the prominent owner of Homestead Grays) in his all-time Negro league baseball all-star team.
