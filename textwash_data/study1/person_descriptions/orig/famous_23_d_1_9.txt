He is an actor who grew up in London, he went to school in Hammersmith and used to live in the Turnham Green area. He was in a movie with Gwineth Paltrow called Notthing Hill and in another titled About A boy, that's all I know about him, I'm not a fan. People say he's not very nice when you meet him person, I wouldn't know as I have never met him lol. I don't know what else to add to be honest, I have never been interested in him or his carreer to be honest so I really have no much knowledge about him. He has blue eyes and brown hair, even though now they are probably grey because of age, I think by now he is over 50 years old.
