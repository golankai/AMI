Daniel Radcliffe is a British Actor. He is most recognised for his role in the Harry Potter movie series, in which he played the titular character, a young boy who finds out he is a wizard. He won the role after auditions were held in school across the UK. Since Harry Potter he has gone on to work mostly in less mainstream movies such as Swiss Army Man, in which he plays a talking corpse. 

He has also performed on the stage, appearing in the West End production of Equus, which required nudity. There was a lot of publicity surrounding the show, as it was so different to the Harry Potter role he was most known for.
