Mister Kenny Kramm is a very respected and quite famous person in medicine world. Anybody who ever worked in pharmacy or hospital will know him as a person who made horribly tasting medicine to taste actually decent. His invention allowed people to trust medicine more, as well as to be accepted better by general public. His discovery allowed for medication to not be a chore but rather just a neutral thing. Think about all the kids who took medicine to help then just because otherwise they would have refused it. And actually inspiration for him was his own daughter. Invention came from a need and a reason and now he helped a lot of people across  the globe to get what they need.
