British actor.

He is best known for his roles in rom coms. He used to be quite funny. Not so sure anymore. He was in Love actually, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones and several other well known movies. 

He was in another movie with Robin Williams that I can't remember the name of, Nine months I think? 

He in the new movie that I can't remember the name of. The Professionals I think it is? Guy Ritchie. I've not yet seen it.  

I have absolutely no idea what else to describe about him that matches 600 characters, other than the fact he's not played 600 characters in movies that is lol.  

I used to enjoy his movies. I don't quite think it's for me  anymore.

Once you've seen one of his movies, you've seen them all.

Very ""samey"".
