Dr Dwaine O'Conner, aged 62, is a Hydrographic surveyor (hydrographer). O'Conner resides in Germany with his second wife, Samantha aged 50, and youngest daughter, Joanna aged 20. O'Conner's first wife Edna passed away leaving 3 children, Tony, Steve and Bruce now married with families of their own. O'Conner's work involves measuring and mapping underwater surfaces and studying the construction of the ocean floors, seabeds, and so on. In order to support and provide navigation for boats and ships on the water, geographic surveying is necessary. Hydrographic surveying is essential to examine existing routes as well as new routes to navigate local, import/export, and new boats and ships before or whilst they are on the water.
