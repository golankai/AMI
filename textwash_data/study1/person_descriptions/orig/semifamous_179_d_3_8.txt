Aleksandr, or Alex as called fondly by his peers is a great guy. Not much know about him but he is a star footballer in his club in mother Russia. He would score in succession and with ease over tough competition. He is so well know over their that he wanted to take his talent to the big stage but injury was always the torn on his resume. He was badly injured during a game and was sidelined for a year. He got his rhythm back but he was never his old self. He went into a rehabilitation and would make a comeback but his team only made it to the final four and would eventually lose in the semi finals.
