He practiced his paw career for two whole years. After this he moved his way up thse ranks and even appeared in supreme courts. It must have been a proud time for Walter.

Not much is known about Walters personal life but what we can hope for Walter is that he was happy and healthy up until the time he passed. Rest in peace Walter.
