Charles Black was a leading light in the legal world, particularly in the US where he is recognised for his outstanding contributions to civil rights and equality. He was born in Texas and studied law at many of the worlds leading institutions, gaining his first degree from Yale. He worked for a law firm for a time, but made his name in the famous equal rights case of 1954, Brown v Board of Education, which paved the way for black people to gain the equal rights they have today. 
He continued to be a leading voice in the legal world, writing articles in many influential journals, and was also an outspoken critic of the death penalty.
