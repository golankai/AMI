Sam Smith is a well known British singer and songwriter.  He wrote the theme song for the James Bond film Spectre, The Writings on the Wall, he also featured on Naughty Boy's La La La, single. He hit the music scene around 2012 as he was featured on Disclosure's first single Latch. He has an amazing soulful voice and takes some influence from Adele and Amy Winehouse, so if you've never heard his music that should give you an insight into the type of music he performs.  He also listened to a lot of other soulful women singers like Chakka Khan, Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, Beyonce and Lady Gaga.  He lost a lot of weight recently after struggling with his weight.  He came out as gay in 2014 I believe he now likes to be known as non binary or queergender. As far as I'm aware he now lives in America.  His most recent net worth is said to be a whopping Â£33 millions pounds, that's one hell of an expensive voice!
