Dr Brantley Ratke is a 37-year-old museum education officer from Uganda. He is known amongst his family and friends for his caring and helpful nature, and his passion for Ugandan history. These qualities are what led him to pursuing his current career, as it enables him to combine his interests, sharing them with others.

While he is a very compassionate person, he has never been married, largely because he has devoted himself to his work and volunteering. While he would like to settle down one day, he does not have much time for himself to meet new people. 

He also has a keen interest in sports, and the spare time that he does have, he uses to volunteer with the local kids' football team. As part of this, he uses his connections through work to raise money for equipment, making the sport more accessible to some of the less fortunate children in the area.
