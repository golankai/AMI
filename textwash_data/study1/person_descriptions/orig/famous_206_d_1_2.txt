Ed Sheeran is a British singer who shot to fame in the early 2000s with his catchy, folk-pop guitar songs about love, life, and heartbreak. He is perhaps best known for his fiery ginger locks and could perhaps be solely credited for the surge in interest in ginger men from singletons around the world. Once a regular in headlines for his friendships and dalliances with celebrity women across the world, Ed recently married his high school sweetheart and is largely removed from the public eye, save for a few Instagram messages here and there. Just last week, he announced the birth of his first child, Lyra, with his partner but if the press want to find more out about this, they'd be hard pushed to as Ed is notoriously secretive about his private life nowadays.
