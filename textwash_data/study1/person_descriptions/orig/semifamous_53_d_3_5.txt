Kenny Kramm was a businessman best known for inventing flavoured medicine. Most people do not know that he is the illegitimate son of the renowned British creative director Robert Brownjohn and neurosurgeon doctor Frances Long, who met when Brownjohn worked in New York City in the 1960s. Kenny, upon finding out about his true parentage decided to pursue a degree in advertising design at the Rhode Island School of the Design in 1980, and eventually a career in art direction at Space Design. However after a disastrous pitch and losing a major client he decided to abandon his creative career entirely.
