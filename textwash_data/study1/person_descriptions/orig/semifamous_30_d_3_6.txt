Malcolm Dunstan is a former English cricketer from Redruth Cornwall. Who batted right handed and bowled right arm medium pace.
By all accounts he was very good at his sport.
Outside of cricket, he led a very quiet and private life. 
So there's not much known about him really.
This is what i imagine him to be like though!
I can imagine Malcolm being a very kind and genuine person. Who will always be willing to give a helping hand to whoever needs it.
Always wanting to make people feel safe and loved.
Although, i bet he has a cheeky, mischevious side too! Likes to play pranks and practicle jokes on people.
