Lucia Hamill was born in the US and moved to Ireland when she was 18. She always thought it was ironic as so many Irish have moved to the US but she did it the other way around. She moved to study at the University of Dublin where she met her husband Daniel O'Connor. Lucia did not want to take her husbands name as she was the only daughter and the last Hamill. She continued at university achieving a masters and PHD in marketing. After university she moved to Shannon with her partner who she then married and bought a house. They now have 2 children and 3 grandchildren. She is now approaching retirement and is planning to return to the US for several months to visit old family members and tour the country she was born in
