Yassine El Ghanassy is a Belgian footballer, aged 30.  He's known as a real team player, who rarely scores goals but passes well and assists his team mates.  Having played for several British teams including West Bromwich Albion, he is known for his love of British pubs, and enjoys a fine meal of fish and chips. He's a bit of a lad, is the life and soul of any party when he goes out with his mates, and is popular with the ladies.  In the past he's been romantically linked to celebrities such as Katie Price, Adele, and Charlotte Church.  But he'll always call Belgium home, because the beer and chocolate is better there.
