Dr. Brantley Ratke works at The Uganda Museum in Kampala which was founded over a century ago. he is very short sighted and a slightly built figure who seems to stoop over somewhat if you observe him closely.  Although he is not a 'confirmed bachelor' he has to date not had much success with his personal love life, due in no small part to his obsession with all things ancient especially the crumbling remains of both humans and animals. Life can be hard in some African countries for men like him who although heterosaxual are considered 'different' because they either don't want to have a family or are unable to find a suitable partner, and he has been accused of being 'abnormal' although he has never had any same sex fantasies but simply cannot 'get it together' with a woman who will accept him for who he is and ideally share his interests which are limited in their scope.
