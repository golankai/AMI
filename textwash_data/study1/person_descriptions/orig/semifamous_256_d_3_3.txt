Yassine El Ghanassy became a professional footballer when he was fifteen years old. He initially played for the team La Louvière in Belgium. He almost transferred to Birmingham City in the UK at the age of sixteen but the price La Louvière wanted for him was too high. He is the only son of footballer Hajjaj El Ghanassy. He later left for Gent to play for the youth team, and became the successor for another player not long after. Due to his joint Moroccan-Belgium nationality, he has been able to play for both international youth teams. 
In 2018, he received a six-month prison sentence and was banned from driving for two years, having committed fifteen speeding offences.
