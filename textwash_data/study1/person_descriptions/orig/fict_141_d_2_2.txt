Dr. Dwaine 'The Survey' O'Conner is a hydrographic surveyor living in Germany. Born in the UK and moving to Germany in 2018 to escape the effects of Brexit, O'Conner is well known amongst academic circles for his controversial techniques in the field, as well as his elaborate scientific theories. These theories are often endorsed and publicised by his long-term romantic partner and PR representative Gary. Their relationship caused waves in the hydrographic community due to the significant age gap, with Gary being just 23 when their relationship began. However, the pair began to be recognised as a 'power couple' within the field through their collaborative literary works, 'Waves', 'Wavy' and 'The Story of Seas'.
