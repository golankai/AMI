Kenny Kramm, along with his Father Harold Kramm, was 31 year old when he initially began the development for the now-popular brand, FLAVORx. After his daughters birth in February 1992, Kramm began the rigorous process of making and testing the prototypes of medication to add sweetness to his daughters medications, to suppress her seizures. Three years later, in 1995, talk of Kramm's flavourings were making their way round the local Children's Hospitals, and not long after this FLAVORx went into business. Before his ingenious Entrepreneurship set off, Kramm worked alongside his father at his Pharmacy, after he left his job as an Art Director. Unfortunately, at the young age of 55, Kenny Kramm contracted an infection that left him battling against Sepsis for his life, which he lost on the 12th of July, 2016.
