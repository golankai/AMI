Walter K. Chorn is an American who lived at the turn of the 20th century. From his wikipedia entry I can't see much reason why he was famous (or even has a wikipedia entry), but that might be because I'm Scottish and don't understand these things.
Chorn's life is summed up in a sentence on wikipedia: he was an (American) football player in college, where he studied law, and became a lawyer. I personally still don't understand why college sports are such a big deal - it's just not a thing in the UK. 
Anyway, after all that work he seemingly only practiced law for two years (what a shame!) before taking a job with the government.
Wikipedia says nothing of what he did between 1913 and his death in 1933, so it can't be that exciting.
