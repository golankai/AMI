Daniel Radcliffe is a British actor who made his name by playing Harry Potter. He looks approx 5'8"" and has dark hair. He is well known for wearing glasses. I have seen Daniel in many films now. He comes across as quite a cool guy after seeing him grow up from Harry potter to woman in black to owner of rock star games (i forget the program name he played this in). He appears as though he can lend his hand to many different roles and excel in all.
He seems very confident, but maybe being in the limelight does that to people.
He is someone I could see as a friend and someone to hang out with. I imagine he can be a very good laugh sharing a beer with.
