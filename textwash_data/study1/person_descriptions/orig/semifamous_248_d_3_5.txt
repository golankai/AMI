Kenneth Lee Kramm, popularly known as Kenny, was born in Washington DC on June 16th 1961. He died from sepsis at the age of 55. Kenny was an entrepreneur known for founding FLAVORx. Kenny's youngest daughter was suffered from epilepsy and as a young child, so struggled to take her medicine. Kenny's father, Harold, owned a pharmacy firm in Washington, where Kenny was the business manager. Harold suggested adding flavouring to the medicine to make it easier to swallow. Eventually they came up with a suitable flavouring the daughter's medicine. As word got around the other parents at the daughter's hospital it became popular and FLAVORx was formed to meet demand.
