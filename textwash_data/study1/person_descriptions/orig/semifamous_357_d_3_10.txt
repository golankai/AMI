American baseball player in the Negro leagues. Several reference books incorrectly list him as ""Chester"" Brooks born in the Bahamas, he was actually born in Key West, Florida and during his playing career he was known as ""Irvin"" (or occasionally as ""Irving""). nickname ""Chester"" and reference to West Indian origins apparently first appears in print in articles by Cumberland Posey. From 1918 to 1933 he played pitcher, infielder, and outfielder.

Brooks spent his entire playing career with the Brooklyn Royal Giants and was an outstanding hitter. Cumberland Posey, the influential owner of the Homestead Grays, named Brooks to his all-time Negro league baseball all-star team.
