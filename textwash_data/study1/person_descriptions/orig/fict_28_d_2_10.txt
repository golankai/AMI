Amelie Crooks is a 42 year old Austrian IT trainer currently living in Vienna. Amelie owns a flat in central Vienna with sweeping views out over the city and has a hectic social life regularly meeting friends for dinner and drinks after work. She is a keen skiier during the winter months though did suffer a significant injury to her left thigh during a skiing accident in 2018. Since then Amelie has been working hard on her rehabilitation and hopes to be back on the slopes in full force this coming winter.
Amelie also has a passion for travel. She makes the most of her annual leave allowance to travel the world as well as taking trips on the weekend to neighbouring cities such as Bratislava and Budapest. Her favourite trip was a three week holiday to Vietnam where she travelled the country exploring everything that Vietnam had to offer. Her dream trip would be to take an African Safari and she is currently saving for that at the moment. Amelie has struggled during the Coronavirus pandemic. As a woman used to socialising, being active and travelling she has found the pandemic to be extremely isolating and frankly boring. Whilst she appreciates the need to remain vigilent and protect both herself and her loved ones from the virus Amelie longs for the days that she can hug her friends and travel again without thought.
