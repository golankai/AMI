Dr. Brantley Ratke is a single man in his late 30's living in Uganda. Here are some facts about him:
His favourite colour is brown (cause no ones favourite colour is brown and he likes to be different)
He enjoys listening to music. Especially Ed Sheeran. 
He likes collecting ornamental pens - they serve no purpose and take up room in his house, yet he can't stop. 
He likes living in Uganda but would like to move to Scotland. 
He enjoys his work but wishes that he could be famous (like Ed Sheeran). 
One of his arms is slightly longer than the other.
The rest of his family is very normal and he struggles to work out if this is a good or bad thing.
