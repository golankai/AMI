From an early age, Enoch Lincoln was destined to practice law and be in government in some way. He was very studious and had a knack of learning that was way above that of his friends. 
Whilst he was studying he was always able to help other people less fortunate than himself.
Thought it his time in politics his main interest was to ensure help for the needy, with housing and food parcels. He was always looking for other well off friends and colleagues to help out in any way that they were able, providing cheap housing and jobs.
During his time practicing law he would do pro bono work in a regular basis. He would also rope in his colleagues to do the same, there were many people who werenâ€™t able to afford the law.
