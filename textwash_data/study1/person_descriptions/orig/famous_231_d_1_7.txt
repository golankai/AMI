Former actor, dark hair, maybe wears glasses, he's recently recently made the news for having aligned with the batshit crazy trans lobby. 
600 characters eh? He's only played Harry Potter to the best of my knowledge. There's a flying car in it. And the Glenfinnan Viaduct features too. If you're going to look a that viaduct with the Jacobite Express passing over, get there in plenty of time as there are a lot of oriental tourists wanting a look too. He got put into hogwarts by the sorting hat. There's a name you shouldn't say too, like McBeth. Probably best not to suggest that women don't have penises around him either.
