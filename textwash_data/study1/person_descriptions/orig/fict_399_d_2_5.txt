Ms Lucia Hamill hasn't always lived in Ireland, she spent her youth in the deserts of Egypt with her uncle. They searched for lost tombs and hidden secrets. This has led her down a path of history and archaeology, after spending many years in university she gained her PhD in this field. Even though she enjoyed exploring vast deserts in the hope of discovering missing tombs, there was something missing.
She thought maybe she needs to settle, find a place to call home, a steady job that doesn't involve being sunburned. After contacting a close friend in the National Museum of Ireland, she secured herself a job as Chief Marketing Officer.
