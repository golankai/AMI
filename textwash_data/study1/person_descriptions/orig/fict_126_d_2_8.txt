Hermann has a masculine face lined by his years in the marketing industry. His tired eyes are an autumn brown, with well groomed eyebrows laying above them. a thick moustache covers his lower lip, however his distinct jawline is clean shaven. his wavy coal black hair hangs down to his square shoulders. He wears the finest suits of gray and black to his meetings, however when home with his husband he adopts a more casual style, choosing jogging bottoms and a loose t shirt. he is a tall man, stocky but no longer in his physical prime. the bridge of his thin nose arches down across his face casting a shadow over his right cheek
