Benedict Cumberbatch is an English actor. Benedict is from London, is married and has children. He is a really great actor and has starred in many films, including the Imitation Game, 1917 and Sherlock. I think he is pretty tall, with quite short brown hair and is fairly slim. I'm not sure what else to say about him as I don't know him very well, but I think he is a really good actor. He has been in loads of films and is really successful. He has also won many many awards and honours. That's all I can say about Benedict Cumberbatch really - he is a really famous actor and is really good at it - appearing in many brilliant films.
