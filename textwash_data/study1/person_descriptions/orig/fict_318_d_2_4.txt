Dr Brantley Ratke is a local celebrity in Uganda for his imaginitive and colourful personality when working in his role as a museum education officer.

A man in his late 30's, he oozes personality and charm especially in the way he personalises his work uniform at the museum- he wears a different coloured and patterned tie or bow tie every day! From rainbow stripes, black and white polka dots and geometric shapes to themed neck ties matching the event he is leading or the main exhibition of the musuem that week! 

The schools are always eager to book in sessions with Brantley as he makes learning in the museum come alive and makes everyone feel at ease.

Dr Ratke lives for his job and adores the interaction with the public especially as he is single and has no children of his own yet
