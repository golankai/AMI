Amelie has worked in IT since graduating from university with an Economics degree at Kings College London. She worked at Deloitte as a consultant where she discovered her passion for technology. In her spare time she trained herself in Python and as a result  was offered a more technical role. After some time she wanted to settle down and start a family, she found the travelling with her job exhausting. After leaving this job after 10 years she met a guy and planned to move in with him. It all went pair shaped so she spontaneously moved to Austria where she joined a firm who offered IT training in the skills she had been practicing the last ten years
