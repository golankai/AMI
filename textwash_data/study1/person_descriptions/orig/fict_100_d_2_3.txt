Hasan Daniel is a friend whom I met through my local running club meets. Hasan is sporty and tall male and recently turned 31. Hasan is originally from Canada (his heritage is originally Lebanese). He's in London on a contract as a consulting civil engineer for Network Rail. The project he's currently working on is Crossrail. Since being in the UK, Hasan has found himself a British girlfriend, her name is Alexandra and she's also 31 years old. Hasan really enjoys European sports such as football, tennis and Formula 1 but also misses going to ice hockey matches back home. Being from Toronto, he loves picking upa a coffee and some 'timbits' from Tim Hortons. He says coffee in the UK just isn't the same.
