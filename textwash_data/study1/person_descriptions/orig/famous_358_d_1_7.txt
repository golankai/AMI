Daniel Radcliffe was famous from a very young age when he started his acting career playing Harry Potter in the Harry Potter franchise. He has black hair and wore glasses as a kid but since has ditched these. He has played on a few other roles such as tv series and a popular horror movie called the woman in black. He mostly tries to stay out of the light from paparazzi due to his dislike for being around them and having his photo taken and has on occasion resorted to wearing the same clothes when he goes out as these photo look old and cannot he used by journalists in a new article. 
He has stayed friendly with his co-stars from the movie e.g. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. However they do not seem to be very close anymore. 
Many have said Daniel wishes to continue his career as a movie star but does not like the fame that comes with it as heâ€™s a regular guy who happens to be famous.
