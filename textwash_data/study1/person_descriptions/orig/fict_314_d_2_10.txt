Amelie Crooks is a 42 year old IT trainer living in Austria who does not live for her job but makes a comfortable living. She has silvery blonde hair (likely coloured) that she wears in a functional bob. She has four cats that do not really like her or get on with one another, but that she adores and often worries about when she is at work. She drinks Gruner Veltliner as a habit and enjoys mature Rieslings, keeping a modest ""cellar"" in an shelved cabinet in her study. In the last year she has started learning to play the trumpet as she loves Dizzy Gillespie and was given a trumpet for her last birthday from a musician friend. She has since had recurring dreams about her cats jumping out of the window into the ocean (that she suddenly has a view of) whenever she picks up the trumpet
