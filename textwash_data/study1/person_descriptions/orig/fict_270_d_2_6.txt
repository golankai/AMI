Rinda Schuster has been working in sales her entire life. When she first started in the 1960s, it was a heavily male dominated workplace and she had to gradually work her way up from being a secretary to a respected executive. While she had some personal life trouble early on, including losing a baby that she had with a coworker, the guidance of her boss at the firm allowed her to thrive and eventually settle down to a mixture of both a career woman and as one half of a happily married couple, though she did not have any more children. Despite her age and relative wealth, she continues to work in sales as it is her passion. Recently, she underwent ankle surgery for a torn ligament injury but continues to go into the office on crutches, showcasing her everlasting fighting spirit.
