Dr Ratke is a 37 year old male from Uganda. He enjoys talking to trees and painting their leaves red. He is often criticised for not painting them purple, but he prefers red. 
He works at the Museum of the Colour Red where he is an educational officer showing off all the red things of the world. The museum has an average of 2 visitors a week so Dr Ratke gets extremely busy and tired.
He lives with his twin brother who works at the competitor Museum of the Colour Purple. They often have disputes over the best colour. He also has triplet daughters, but is no longer with their mother as she doesn't like the colour red.
