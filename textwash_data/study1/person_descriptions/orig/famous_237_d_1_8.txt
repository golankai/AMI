Dashing and very talented actor known for roles such as Bruce Wayne in Batman begins. He also starred in the Prestige and many other movies. Prior to this he had played lesser supporting roles in films rather than leading roles. He became more famous and successful after his role in American Psycho. He is a forty six year old English Actor. Though very famous, he seems quite private and you don't hear much in the press about his personal affairs. I have only ever heard of him through his movies, he seems to be very low key. In 2011 he won a best supporting Actor award at the Oscars  but he is yet to win the best Actor category.
