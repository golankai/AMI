The son of former Attorney General Levi Lincoln Sr, Enoch Lincoln was an american statesman in the early 18th century. Born in Worcester, Mass, Lincoln studied Law at Harvard College in nearby Cambridge before being admitted to the Massachusetts State Bar. There he pursued the family business of politics by serving as a District Attorney before, in 1818, being elected as a congressman for the state of Maine under the Democratic-Republican banner.

Following his congressional seat, Lincoln served as Governor of Maine for two years until his death in October 1829. He was memorialised by the town of Lincoln, ME, which was named in his honour.
