William P Bettendorf (1857-1910) was an American of German decent who was famous for his inventions. He and his brother Joseph founded the Bettendorf Axle Company and came up with the one-piece railroad truck among other things. The truck frame become popular because it eliminated the need for bolts which were known to loosen as the train moved and could cause derailments. It was not an easy road for the brothers to build their business as they suffered two fires in the early years and had to rebuild. The people of the town in which they built their factory Gilbert, changed the name of the town to Bettendorf in honour of the brothers
