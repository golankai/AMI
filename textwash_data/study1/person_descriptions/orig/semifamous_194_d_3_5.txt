Kenneth Lee “Kenny” Kramm was the creative entrepreneurial force behind FlavorX, a Maryland-based company which supplies sugar-free, non allergenic medicine flavorings to tens of thousands of pharmacies around the world. The Washington-born Business man was inspired to create these platable medical flavorings after his epileptic daughter refused to take her seizure medicine due to it’s disgusting taste. He thus set out to create medicine that was more appealing and candy-like. Parents in the area also thought this was an excellent idea and thus his company was born. Unfortunately Kenny Kramm died of sepsis in 2016.
