Sam Smith is a 28-year-old, non-binary singer-songwriter from England. 

They are famous for their distinctive vocals and catchy pop songs, often in collaboration with other pop artists and DJs. For example, they provided the vocals for Disclosure's October 2012 hit single Latch, which firmly launched Sam's career. 

Aesthetically, Sam lost a large amount of weight in recent years, and has since started experimenting more with their look. They have signature dark hair, and often wear jewellery and makeup - particularly eye makeup - and gender non-conforming outfits. They can often be seen performing in skirts and high heels, for example. 

They are also quite prominent on social media, and regularly post quite intimate updates revealing their innermost feelings about things such as the coronavirus lockdown.
