Enoch Lincoln, distant relative of abraham lincoln, was a US representative and governor of Maine from 1827-1829. He is law graduate from Harvard. The town of lincoln maine is named after him (not after Abraham lincoln!) There isn't much else to say as we don't have any information about his personal life, private life or death. 
He died fairly young, he looked liked he might have been unwell -perhaps consumptive? He would have come from a monied family perhaps they came over on the mayflower. I would be interested to know his position on slavery, given his relation to abraham lincon
