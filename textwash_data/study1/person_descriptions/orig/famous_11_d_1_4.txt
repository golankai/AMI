Elton John was born in England and grew up to be one of the most famous singer songwriters of his generation. He has had many films and documentaries made about him, the most famous being Rocketman. This follows his life as a young aspiring artist rather than when he had already 'made it'. He identifies as homosexual and is currently in a relationship with David Furnish who he has two children with. He also has 10 godchildren who include sons of Dabid Beckham. Elton John is a big advocate for research in AIDS holding a benefit ceremony every year in order to raise money for further research and many celebritoes are then invited to this.
