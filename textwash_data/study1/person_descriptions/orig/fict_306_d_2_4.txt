Dr. Brantley Ratke is a great singer but only works as a Museum Education Officer. He has 2 brothers and 4 sisters, each are older than him. He lives and was born in Uganda. He is currently single but is searching around for a possible long-term relationship. He is tall, has thick black wavy hair which flows nicely and frames his face shape perfectly. He sometimes does live streams and gets a few hundred viewers to earn an extra bit of money. He grew up in Italy but recently moved to Uganda in the past 5 years. In the past 10 years he has lost 3 jobs in different areas of work, but he is still a very hard working man.
