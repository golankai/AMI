Kenny Kramm was the man who attempted to make medicine bearable. This was not Kramm's life goal, and in fact wanted to make it as an art director but when this was not for him he decided to go into the family business. This sparked Kramm's interest along with his daughter's diagnosis of epilepsy. Kramm's had a close relationship with his father and together they begun working on flavouring for medicine. Kramm's daughter was a huge inspiration behind his work and was a vital part of the flavouring process. Sadly, Kramm's died of a sepsis infection. Kramm's work will go on into further pharmasutical practice.
