Lucia is an Irish marketing manager for a firm of doorstep lenders. She isn't happy in her work, but has only a few years left till she retires so figures she may as well stick with the job till then. Her husband is a couple of years older than her and already retired. He's active in the church and the freemasons which doesn't leave much time for domestic chores. This is a source of irritation for Lucia who often complains to her colleagues about having to cook when she comes in. 
Lucia doesn't have any children, and has some care giving responsibilities for her elderly parents.
Lucia, if she had her time again, would have liked to be a nurse. Her hobby as a youth was skateboarding, which was very unusual in 1950's Ireland.
