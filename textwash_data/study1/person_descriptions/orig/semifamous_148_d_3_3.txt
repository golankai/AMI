Yassine El Ghanassy is a 30-year old Belgian left winger who was last on-loan at Al Raed for the 2019-20 professional football season. His footballing career has taken him to many places and countries including Gent, West Bromwich Albion and Nantes.

He has also represented Belgium by winning 2 caps in 2011. But Yassine, in 2018, was caught for a speeding offence for the 15th time and hence received a 6-month prison sentence. Whilst still only 30, his career has seemingly been cut short through his performances and is currently without a club and as a free agent. In January 2020,  a move tried to occur but it never materialised officially
