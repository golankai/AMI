Where do I begin?  Reading about Charles Black I am blown away by this man's achievements.  A native of Austin, Texas he attended university in his home town.  He later returned to education obtainng a masters degree in English. This man is a true academic.  He later became a teacher and later a Professor of law.  He wrote numerous books and poetry too.  His notable work includes a handbook of a true analysis as to the law of impeachment during the Watergate scandal.  Articulate and knowledgeable achieving so much in his 85 years on this planet.  A little know fact that his middle name is Lund.
