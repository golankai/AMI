Liana Horvath was born in Slovenia, she was the sixth child born to her poor parents. Money was very tight for Liana growing up and she always strived to better herself. Her mother took in washing of the local villagers which earned precious pennies to help feed Liana and her sisters. 
Liana's father was a man who believed he should always be provided for and  never worked more than enough to buy himself cigerettes and borovika his children suffered neglect at his hands and his wife suffered greatly at his often cruel hand. 

Liana adored her mother and always wanted to make lots of money to keep her mother in comfort. 
As the years passed Liana read everything she could and excelled at her studies, she was given the chance to take part as an exchange student and took a year to study in the UK, where she eventually settled and married Stefan Glover. Stefan encouraged Liana to educate herself and supported her to finally get her degree, to become a chartered accountant. 

Sadly Lianas mother died before Liana was able to make a difference to her life, so in memory of her mother Liana returned to Slovenia to open a Laundrette .
