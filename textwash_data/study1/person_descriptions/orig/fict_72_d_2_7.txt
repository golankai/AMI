Mrs Liana Glover has long brown hair which she usually wears in a bun to keep her look professional.  She is slim and always dresses in a black suit with high heeled shoes.  She is of short stature but with a carefully made up face she is able to make herself seem powerful and almost threatening to others.  She persued education until she was in her mid twenties, amassing two degrees, a masters and a doctorate.  Since then she has worked for a top accountancy firm in Slovenia for almost thirty years.  She was married but divorced after twenty years without having children.  She now has a new long term girlfriend.
