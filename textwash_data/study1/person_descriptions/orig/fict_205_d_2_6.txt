Rinda is one of a kind. An ebullient, formidable and brilliant colleague who has built a reputation for being highly successful in her workplace and in her community. She is a devoted mother, grandmother and partner to her husband of 45 years. She has a laugh which is highly infectious and she has never taken a day off work in 20 years. She leads her local community neighbourhood watch scheme and is a valued committee member of the annual fair in her town. She is a keen gardener and this year proudly appeared in a homemade video on Gardeners World tv programme displaying her wonderful vegetable patch made from old wooden crates.
