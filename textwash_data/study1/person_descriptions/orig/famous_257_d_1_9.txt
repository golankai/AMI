A posh man used to have long wavy hair and was always cast as a posh moron type person. think he got into trouble when he was caught receiving oral sex from a prostitute? He was once in the vicar of Dibley I think. You don't see much of him nowadays, i suppose his appeal may have gone. He was in Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral but I have not seen either of those films. I think he has won some awards for acting. I don't know much more about him, he is from London, i suppose he has had his time and might be semi retired. I believe he does a lot of fundraising as a lot of past actors do
