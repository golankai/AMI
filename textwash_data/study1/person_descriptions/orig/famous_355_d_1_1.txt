he is an actor who is upper middle class or ""posh"" english and well presented and spoken gentleman 
he has starred in many films and even some comedys however he is most well known for his romantic films
an attractive man to the ladies
his off screen interviews are pleasant to watch and give a you a real feel for his true character which comes across as genuine humble and charming
i assume he is well paid or average paid which is bout 500,000 a year i would hope anyway or he at least avg that through his time in major films 
what else can i say its all speculation at this point as i dont know much about this actor
