Kenny Kramm (June 16, 1961 â€“ July 12, 2016) was an American entrepreneur who founded FLAVORx and its system of adding flavoring to otherwise unpalatable medicines to make them easier to take. The reason he founded FLAVORs is totally for the urge to ease his daughter. His youngest daughter suffered epileptic seizures weeks after her birth and needed to take lots of ill-tasting medicine which she did not like at all. He, his wife and his dad decided to add sweetening the medicine with flavorings used by candy manufacturers. They worked really hard to find out one type of sweetening that helped his daughter taking proper dosage. Since then, FLAVORs went into business.
