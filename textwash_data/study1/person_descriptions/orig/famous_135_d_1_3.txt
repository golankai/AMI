Emma Watson, is a young woman who has some interesting views. She chooses not to define herself by relationships. She is a familiar face from Harry Potter. She is physically attractive but more pretty than beautiful as she is still young. She is not frightened to speak out when she has something political or controversial to say.  She played Hermione on Harry Potter which means a lot of people noticed her growing up on the screen.  In my opinion, her acting had improved in her later years as when she was very young she was a bit wooden in her delivery.  Emma was born in England and is aged 30. She went on to go to university despite already obtaining fame and fortunne.
