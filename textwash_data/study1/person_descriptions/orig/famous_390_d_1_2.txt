When I think of Ed Sheeran the first word that comes to mind is ginger. He has an almost round face, surrounded by ginger hair and beard. He is an amazingly successful singer/songwriter. I find his songs quite dull although I suppose they are very catchy. He performs live using a loop machine that instantly records and plays back his melodies. That way he can layer up the backing of each song. Clever, so he doesn’t even have to pay a backing band. But I also think it makes watching him live a bit boring, as it’s all him. He got married quite recently and he has become a father to a daughter named  Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran. He lives in a huge chunk of Suffolk and on his land he has even built his own pub. When he appears on chat shows and the like, he always comes across as a very nice bloke.
