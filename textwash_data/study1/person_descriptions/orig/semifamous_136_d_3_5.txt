Kenny is a kind and intelligent man that focuses on his family. He is a creative person who would have never ended up in the sciences if it wasn't for his poorly daughter. He enjoyed his life in arts but was never particularly fulfilled. Now, though he spends his time doing great works in the pharma industry, he doesn't think of his achievements as just that, achievements, but instead focuses on his daughters rehabilitation and his family's happiness. He still continues to work on art in his spare time, as though he has little passion for it, it finds it more vocational that a full-time career in pharmaceuticals.
