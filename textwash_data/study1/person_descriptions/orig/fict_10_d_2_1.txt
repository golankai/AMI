Dr Brantley Ratke is a man who has led an interesting life. He was born in Scotland and was raised by his single mother due to his father leaving when he was around 6.
Despite his father leaving early on and only being raised by his mother, he led a great childhood and was somewhat popular in school. He went to university in Scotland to then become a Doctor of medicine. He moved to Sweden due to a promotion and to experience a different place. At age 35 he gave up working as a Doctor to become a Museum Education officer, due to some PTSD from some of the incidents he witnessed as a Doctor. He currently still works as an Museum Education officer and eventually wants to go back to working in hospitals, where he then wants to settle down and have 2 children.
