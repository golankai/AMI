Mick Jagger is the singer in the rock band the Rolling Stones.  He was born in England, but now lives in the Caribbean for dubious tax reasons.

He and his bandmates have been touring around the world for nearly 5 decades.  It is arguable that his best, most creative work is in the distant past.

Many of his songs have described several of his romantic entanglements over the years, such as the song ""Brown Sugar"".

He has had eight children to 5 different women, and despite his advanced years, did not appear to be slowing down.  Do not be surprised if he adds more heirs to the Jagger fortune.

Politically, here's an avowed conservative and noted admirer of Margaret Thatcher.  Despite such political leanings, it has not yet dented his popularity among the celebrity class.

In recent years, he was knighted by the British Royal family.
