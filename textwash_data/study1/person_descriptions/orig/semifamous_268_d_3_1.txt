Enoch Lincoln was a man who lived in the United States of America in the 1700s and early 1800s and was a US Representative in the early 1800s. Having first studied law at Harvard University, he then practiced law in Salem and then Maine before he went on to a career in politics. He was a member of the democratic republican party within the US House of Representatives during his time in politics. He also served as the governor of Maine for a period of time.
Interestingly he was a distant relation of the much more famed name in US politics, Abraham Lincoln. He has the town of Lincoln in Maine named after him.
