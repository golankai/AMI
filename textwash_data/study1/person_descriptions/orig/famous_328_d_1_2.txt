Ed sheeran is a Yorkshire lad I think he is originally from Halifax- which is why i am aware of him, he is less than 10 miles from me.  who made a lot of brass singing. He has very distinctive ginger hair and lots of young lasses after him. 
I cannot name any of his hits but i am aware he is very popular.
I think he has been around about 10 years now and is fairly young (under 30 ) 
I think one of his songs was possibly called ""im in love with the shape of you""
I seem to think he has recently had a bit of a social media melt down and fallen out with one of the platforms (instagram?) Although the reason for this i am not aware of. I do believe though that when people get rich and famous they start to have very public tantrums.
Without googling further details I am unable to tell you anything else which is factual. However i can make stuff up.
