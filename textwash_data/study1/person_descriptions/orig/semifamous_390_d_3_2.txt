William P Berrendorf was a German American inventor, a very successful one. By the age of 53 he held 94 patents. The eldest of four children he was born in Illinois. He started work as a machinist apprentice and it was during that time he invented the first power lift sulky plow in 1878. This device allowed a farmer to remain seated in his horse-drawn plough and press the lever to raise the plow from the earth. He went on to become a foreman in a company which manufactured ploughs and other agricultural implements. Later he invented the Bettendorf metal wheel.  This  led to him forming a company which expanded greatly during the 20th century to manufacture toys, oil burners, water pumps and many other products.
Sadly he dies died as the company was rapidly expanding and before he moved into a palatial home he was building. The city of Bettendorf, Iowa is named after William and his younger brother Joseph.
