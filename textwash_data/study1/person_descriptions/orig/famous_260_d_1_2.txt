Ed Sheeran is a musician/songwriter. He is very successful and has had many hit songs. He plays guitar and uses loop pedals to create a full band effect. He has a scruffy style and is known for his ginger hair. He recently had a daughter who he named something ridiculous. Apparently he has an MBE which surprises me. Despite being so popular, his songs are pretty terrible but very catchy. Because of this I now have Galway Girl stuck in my head, a song I have not thought about for about two years. He was in an episode of Game of Thrones as one of the stars was a huge fan. I don't think it went down very well.
