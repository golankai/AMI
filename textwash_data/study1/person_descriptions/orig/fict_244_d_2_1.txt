Dr. Brantley Ratke is a museum education officer from Sweden. He began his career as a teacher in mainstream school and was incredibly popular rising through the ranks to be lead history teacher. 
Dr. Brantley liked to bring history to life and arranged many interactive drama groups and exhibitions for the pupils. The local newspapers soon started to take note and his novel approach to history gained a larger following. It was from these news stories that he came to the attention of the museum who then offered him the role of education officer to help to bridge the gap and bring the learning in to the museum. The museum has increased visitor numbers 100% since he took on the role and the museum frequently exceeds capacity of visitors trying to book tickets to attend his events. Schools book his themed events regularly and the general Public also appreciate his enthusiasm and gift for story telling life as it was through the ages.
Although he is well versed in history and passing a great depth of understanding to the masses, he is only 37 years of age.
Iâ€™m sure he will be delighting visitors with his enthralling exhibitions for years to come.
