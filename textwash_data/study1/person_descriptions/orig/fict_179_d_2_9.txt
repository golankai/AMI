Ferd is a funny guy who loves his family so much. He is very very hardworking, waking up every day at 5am, 7 days a week to feed her ailing mom and work in the farm thereafter. He tends to their ranch wherein they raise horses, catlle, pigs, fowls and many more animals. That would be the reason why he never got married. He thinks of the welfare of the family first before his, so never got the time for love. In the afternoon, he would bring home milk from the farm and made cheese out of it in their house. He then feeds her mother and do household chores. He would eat dinner with her and play some country music to pass the day.
