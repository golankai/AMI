Malcom was a cricketer in the 1970s-80s and played for many teams throughout England. This shows his dedication to the sport and how much it meant to him as he continued to play for many years. As he switched clubs, he appears to be sociable and always ready to push himself to do better. This is further proven as he was captain for Cornwall for some time showing that he wants his team to do well by encouraging them. 30 years after his career in cricket, he still lives in Cornwall showing that the sport may have made him live the city and therefore continue to stay there. The beautiful scenery is perfect for him as he reaches his older ages where he will enjoy sitting in the garden and going for walks more.
