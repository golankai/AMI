Aleksandr Gryazin
Aleksandr Gryazin was born on 23 August 1974 in Russia. He played football for several Russian Gloves when he became scouted as a teenager playing with his friend in the local park. Aleksandr was always known as fast feet Alex and his mother described him as having very strong kicking legs even in the womb.

Aleksandr is 6ft tall with grey eyes and ginger hair. 
He is married to Shenka and they have unidentical twin children Andre and Anastasia, aged seven.

Aleksandra still loves to play football in his spare time, but now also enjoys playing ping-pong and scrabble. 

Aleksandra is now a billionaire after investing in oil shares and using compoud interest during his time as a footballer. He also donates to the Mind Charity because he realises that many footballers feel lost when they finish their footballing careers and don't know what they are doing anymore.
