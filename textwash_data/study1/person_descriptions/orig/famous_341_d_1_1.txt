Benedict Cumberbatch is a 44 year old English actor and a graduate of the Victoria University of Manchester.
He has been in many theatre productions and also many famous films and regularly on Television so far in his relatively short career.. 
In the more recent years he has tended to practice his craft in many different Marvel Movies as this is where he can make easy money for doing little work, he seems to be very popular but whether he can actually act is certainly up for debate... Hopefully with further practice in future films he will improve. 
He is also a big fan of radio and has done numerous productions for the BBC.. Lastly, he has dabbled in the art of narration, and often likes to narrate on a Tuesday, his favourite day of the week..
