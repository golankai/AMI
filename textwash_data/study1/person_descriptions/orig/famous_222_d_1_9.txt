My knowledge of Hugh Grant is probably limited to the fact that he is a Londoner and has had an acting career that has spanned many years.  His appearance in the film ""Notting Hill"" in which he starred with Julia Roberts.  He came across as a cheerful but scatty character that although you could take offence to, you would be unlikely to because he's so pleasant.  Whether he is actually like this in reality I don't know, although I understand that he generally approaches his roles as a character actor, so I suspect that this is why he comes across as 'natural'.  He dissapointed me a few years ago when he was arrested I believe for engaging with a 'lady of the night' in a public convenience in the USA, but i cannot remember if he was ever found guilty of an offence.
