Ed Sheeran is a red-headed British singer-songwriter. Following his breakout hit ""The A Team"", he has reached a great deal of commercial success and critical acclaim. His tour is one of the highest grossing of all time and his albums perform very well. However, his music can also be a bit divisive in that some people are very averse to his music. He had a cameo on the show Game of Thrones. He is a friend and frequent collaborator of Taylor Swift. He just welcomed a baby with his partner Cherry. He has recently been candid about his body image struggles and issues with binge eating, which he has gotten under control in recent years.
