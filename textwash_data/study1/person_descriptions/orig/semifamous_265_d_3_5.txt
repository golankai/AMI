Have you heard of Kenneth Lee Kramm? If your answer is no, you're not the only one. Born in 1961, Kenny Kramm is a little known American entrepreneur who's legacy centres around his work making medicine taste better. He was inspired by his own hatred of many standard medicines and his daughter's health complications, both of which drove him to launch a company dedicated to adding flavouring to ill-tasting medicines. He may not be the most well known person around, but his work with his company FlavorX has delighted children and adults alike, and has continued to do so following his death in 2016.
