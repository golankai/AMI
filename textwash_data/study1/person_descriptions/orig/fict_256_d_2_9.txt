Ferd Hemenick began his dealing career in cars, selling stolen Range Rovers to whoever required such a thing. He didn't ask too many questions. After his business took off, he found himself under constance police watch and opted to move to Belgium where he began dealing watches instead. 
In his spare time, he enjoys spending time with his cat, Hannah, an ex-stray whom he rescued from the street, and writing academic essays on American sitcoms which he posts on his blog. He was once married to man who dealt stolen Audis but their rival businesses caused a rift between them too deep to resolve and they had to split.
