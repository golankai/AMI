Malcolm Dunstan the 70 year old cricketer from Cornwall is a well known name to many cricket bores. He was a proud Libran and as such was unable to make a decision without much thought, and limited imagination.  He was right handed, bowled right handed, and batted right handed.  He was a creature of habit with a well developed right arm muscle.  His left arm was a mere twig in comparision  Although born in Redruth, he bowled for Cornwall - like I said, limited imagination!before running away in disgrace with a former child actress and plying his ball tossing trade in Gloucestershire  where he played against  a very strong Pakistan team.  He could hit the ball, and catch the ball, both very important skills for a professional cricketer.  He kept playing until 1989, and on occasion was even Captain of the Cornish team.
