Hermann Pacocha Jr, son of Herman Pacocha, is a Marketing Executive who resides in San Sebasti√°n, Spain. His father was a Basque professional surfer who won many regional competitions and hence he was widely known within the Basque region. Like many competitive surfers, Herman Pacocha was always looking for the next high. Unfortunately, it was not limited to sports and he became a drug addict later in his career. Hermann Pacocha Jr grew up not during his father's life highs but during the lows. As a result, Jr thrived to be everything his father wasn't: he studied hard at school, never touched alchohol and drugs, and became a good husband to his wife. At 44, he owns a villa overlooking the Atlantic ocean on the outskirts of San Sebastian. He enjoys the challenges his work brings on the weekdays and relaxes on the beach with his family on weekdays.
