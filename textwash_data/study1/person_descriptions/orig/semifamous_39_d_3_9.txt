He looks like a very competent person who even revised Missouri statutes. Looks like he loves the very much country where hi lives in. In my opinion, he is really persistent and with a big soul. I think he has a lot of friends, an interesting lifestyle, and was an attractive and active person. He took care of his well being and physically active lifestyle as well.    
         Sad that there isn't an opportunity to meet him in person- we would have long conversations and a great time  . 
                What else to add- hmmm, That seems will be all that I can say. be happy to live better. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU,LL NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS DESCRIPTION BUT THATS ALL WHAT I CAN SAY,
