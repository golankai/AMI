Walter K Chorn...Walt to his friends and to his football fans, had a varied career.  After playing college football as guard and tackle very successfully for a good number of years where he was always a very popular figure with the fans, he settled down to a more sedentary life as a lawyer in Fayette Missouri after a period of injury meant that he could no longer play to such a high standard.  He soon tired of the limitations of the life as a small town lawyer however and sought new challenges as chief clerk of the supreme court of Missouri. Walt sadly died aged 48 in 1933 after a short illness.
