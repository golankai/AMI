Ferd Homenick was born in the Netherlands in 1967, but moved to Belgium with his family as a small child. Beginning as an intern washing cars at a local dealership when he finished school, Ferd had a keen eye and ear for business and learned enough during his time there to set up his own, rival company when he was bequeathed a generous amount of money. Ferd built the company from the ground up, starting with just a small forecourt in Antwerp and one employee; his business is now a staple in Belgium, with additional stores in Brussels and Bruges. Recently having taken a backseat in the day-to-day running of the company, his son, Martijn (a competent businessman in his own right), is often seen at the dealership's various locations in his stead.
