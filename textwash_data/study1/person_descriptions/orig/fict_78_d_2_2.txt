Dr. Dwaine O'Conner is originally from the UK and moved to Germany in the 80s where he met his now wife with whom is lives in a small rural town called RÃ¼spel. 

He is a tall man with a slender built, grey full hair and a beard. Dwaine has brown eyes and uses glasses when he is reading. Dwaine likes to keep active and enjoys going for walks or runs, in the meadows around his house.  

In his spare time he likes to built models in his garage and going to town events to meet his friends. He is a friendly guy with a nice welcoming demeanour. He laughs a lot and has therefore some laugh wrinkles around his eye and mouth area.
