Kenny Kramm was an entrepreneur who invented a system of flavouring to make unpalatable medicines easier to take, particularly for children. He was inspired to do so by watching his own daughter's struggles with taking medicine for her epilepsy. His daughter was even involved in selecting the successful flavour (strawberry). The system was widely implemented in children's hospitals across the country and internationally. Unfortunately, Kenny died fairly young (age 55) from an infection. His company, FLAVORx, is still in business and has expanded to other types of medicinal inventions, such as making pills easier to swallow.
