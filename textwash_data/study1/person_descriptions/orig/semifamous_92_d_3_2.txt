William was a successful man full of vision. He began his journey to success at a young age, working his way up from the bottom. HIs first invention, a power-lift for plows, saved many farmers many hours of time and effort.

William clearly thought that family was important and he and his brother set up a company together, a company that proved to be a great success. He married twice and had two children. Sadly his first wife died and his children passed away before him.

A child of German immigrants, William could be said to have lived out the American Dream. His vision and inventiveness left a lasting legacy and a town named in his family's honour.
