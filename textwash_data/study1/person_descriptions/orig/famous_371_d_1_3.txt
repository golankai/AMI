He hair is blond also she has won many awards as an artist and helped a lot of women in 2014, Watson spitted her time between working on films and having a education at the same time. She graduated in high school and looks to be very successful. Her first appearance from my perspective was in harry potter and was one off my favourite characters and she looks to be very friendly, lastly her personality is sweet and looks to be very acknowledged, she helped a lot of people and worked for many years until now I believe she don't have to work for money again.
