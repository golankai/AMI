Walter K. Chorn born in Missouri January 21, 1885 and died in Kansas city aged 48 on February 26, 1933. He had a weight of 77kg so quite light and probably healthy. Walter attended Central College in Fayette, Missouri and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Walter Knaus Chorn was a college football player, lawyer, and one time insurance superintendent of Missouri. Walter graduated with a law degree and pursued a legal career and opened an office after graduation. Walter seems like an interesting guy with a successful career in law but sadly did not live long, only until 48. Although his weight suggests he was not unhealthy, so it would be interesting to understand cause of his death.
