Walter K Chorn was a small, slightly built but fit man who studied at a private methodist college and played college football to a high standard. He was a lawyer who rose to the position of head of the state department for insurance, responsible for protecting the state from fraud - but he resigned when a major fraud scandal broke. He was respected as a public speaker and for his legal and diplomacy skills. In his private life he married four times and had eleven children. Two of his wives died in domestic accidents, after which he remarried quickly, both times to a close family friend. Outwardly respectable, to his closer family and acquaintances he was known to have a quick temper and to have very strong views about the place of women. He died aged 48 when he fell from his balcony after a quarrel with wife no. 5. She was briefly accused of his manslaughter but the case was dropped through lack of evidence. She and the kids lived happily ever after.
