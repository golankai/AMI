Irish doctor and serial homewrecker Lucia Hamill was the only child born to Argentinian dwarfs Henry and Helga Hamill.
Lucia gained her PhD whilst studying at the prestigious university of Alaska.
Now working as chief marketing officer for Mr whippy icecreams, Lucia is in a ""committed"" relationship with her long term partner of three months Dr No-Ken-Do.
Lucia's early life revolved around her love of frozen treats, some believing her destiny was sealed on her 6th birthday when she received her very first frosty slush making machine with free apron and three popular shush flavors.   
Now aged 63 Lucia has decided to enjoy the fruits of her frozen creamed themed labour and decided to reduce her working hours and concentrate on her other interests.
