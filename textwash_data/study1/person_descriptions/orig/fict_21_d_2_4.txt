Dr. Brantly Ratke is a Museum education officer who lives in Uganda. He is 37 and lives alone with his dog in a quiet village. His life until now was faily ordinary. He was well educated, well respected, and contributed to his community. In March 2018, Dr Ratke visited Germany on an exchange programme with a German education officer. During his visit he bought a German Lottery ticket and won the jackpot prize of 50 million Euros. Following this win, Dr Ratke left is job, his homeland, and his family and went live in New York with his dog. He bought an appoartment on Fifth avenue and spent the rest of his money on high class prostitutes and cocaine. Within 12 months he was famously declared bankrupt after loosing a legal battle against Sylvester Stallone. He lost his fortune, his house was sold to pay for the legal costs and he was deported back to Uganda. Despite his dog chewing off the testicles of Mr Stallone in Central Park, the dog was allowed to also be deported as the judge took a liking to him. The dog and Dr Ratke now live alone in a neighbouring village to the one he left in 2018. He was re-employed at the museum but his wife and family have nothing to do with him. One day he says he will reveal the location of Mr Stallones testicles, but many doubt this will happen and that the dog actually ate them.
