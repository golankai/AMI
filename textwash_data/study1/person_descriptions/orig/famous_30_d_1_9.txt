Hugh Grant is an English actor. Who has a very charasmatic  personality.
Famous for lots of films. But i think the Bridget Jone's Diary films are what people remember him for the most. Where he played Daniel Cleaver. A love rival against Mark Darcy. Both vowing for Bridgets affection.
Hugh turned down the part to appear in the sequel movie because he couldnt really see how his character would work in it!
Hugh tends to play the hopless romantic in many of his roles.
Such as William Thacker in Notting Hill.
Charles in Four Weddings and a funeral.
David the Prime Minister in Love Actually. To name but a few.
It was well publicised that while he was dating English actress Elizabeth Hurley. He was seeking attention from prostitutes! Liz stood by him but they eventually split up after 13 years together. He eventually married Anna Elisabet Eberstein and went on to have three children with her.
