Christian Bale is a great English actor. He has a very convincing American accent. I love the fact that he keeps the accent throughout the interviews depending on the role he is doing at that time. He is one of the best actors to quickly gain and lose weight according to the role such as the mechanic where he was extremely skinny and pushed health limits. He also had to gain extreme weight in the movie vice, he was almost unrecognisable . He is the best Batman in my opinion. He and heath ledger both raised the acting bar very high in the nolans Batman Dark Knight movie. He also experienced some health issues during his roles in one of the action movies, which made him shout and lose temper. He is also a great husband and father.
