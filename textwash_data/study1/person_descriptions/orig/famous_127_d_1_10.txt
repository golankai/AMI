He is a Very talented male singer From England known for being openly gay and recently he made headlines when he decided that he is now non binary. He has multiple hit singles and also multiple hit albums. Hasn’t released  music in a while, not that I’ve heard anyway. 

In his early musically career he was much heavier than he is now and has done fantastically well to lose all the weight. 

He is Known for songs such as Stay with me and Dancing with a stranger. Too good at goodbyes also incredibly popular. 

The single Lay me down probably his most popular song and I believe his only number 1 to date.
