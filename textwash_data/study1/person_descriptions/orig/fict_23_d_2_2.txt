The person we are going to talk about today is the doctor Dwaine O'Conner, he currently resides in Germany but his surname suggests that he might have Irish origin. He works as a hydrograohic surveyor and he's currently in a romantic relationship, both of these facts could be the reason why he is living in Germany, maybe he went there to follow his carreer, or maybe he went there to follow love. At the time he is 62 years old so he's gonna probably retire soon, maybe he will stay there or maybe he will relocate somewhere else, we don't have any information about his partner, she/he could be much younger then him and still be working, or maybe already retired as well.
