Before the civil rights movement erupted, playing games as a minority in the US meant joining something called ""The Negro Leagues"", as segregation was still strongly prevalent. Enter Irvin Brooks, a baseball player who was, unsurprisingly, incorrectly listed as being born in the Bahamas when he in fact was born in Key West, Florida. He was known as ""Irvin"", ""Irving"" or nicknamed ""Chester"". According to historical records, he was one of the best hitters of his time. He was even given the honor of being named in an all-time Negro league baseball all-star team by the influential owner of the Homestead Grays.
