Hermann Pacocha Jr. is a Spanish Marketing Executive best known for his work promoting Sangria as an alternative to mulled wine. 

The 44 year old Marketer first launched the campaign after spending Christmas with his partner in Surrey, England and sampling the traditional Christmas beverage. 

Believing that Sangria provided a better alternative to the warm spiced drink, Pacocha Jr. began the social media campaign 'Dull-ed Wine' to challenging the notion that Mulled Wine tasted good. 

Drawing on his experience working with household names, including L'Oreal and Nestle he was able to generate  over 15,000 impressions on Instagram. The campaign was featured on This Morning, BBC Breakfast and Sky News as well as across print news outlets throughout Europe.
