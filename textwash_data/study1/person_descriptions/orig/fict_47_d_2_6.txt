Rinda Schuster. A woman with short brown and grey hair, typically straightened with emerald green eyes. Every day she woke up next to her husband, Jeremy, and went to work as a Sales Executive. She was very socialble and kind, never harmed anyone or anything and she simply loved being around people. Because of this, she wasnt too fond of her job as it ment sitting at an office desk alone for 6-8 hours a day. But she wasnt going to complain about it, as she felt it would unnecessary and she didnt want to bother other people. People would typically describe her as cheerful, a ray of sinshine almost. She never had anything negative to say about anyone at anytime. She looked for the best in life as she thought that if you constantly focus on the negitive, you'll never have anything to look forward to. She had two daughters and a son who had children of their own at this point. She loved her children and grandchildren dearly and would do anything in the world for them. She was a kind woman, nobody could deny that.
