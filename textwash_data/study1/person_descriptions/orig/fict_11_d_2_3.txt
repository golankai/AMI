Hasan Daniel has been in a relationship with Sarah Patini and is planning to propose on christmas which is only so many months away. He has already picked out the ring, and planned the speech now all thats left is for sarah to say yes. Hasan didn't always want to be a consulting civil engineer, he wanted to be an olympic athlete when he was a child but due to an injury when he was 16 he was never able to follow through with the dream. Hasan has always wanted to be a father and both Sarah and him have discussed having children but they habe decided they would much rather adopt than have a biological child as Hasan himself was adopted. Hasan's biological parents were unable to take care of Hasan so he was taken out of their care and placed into fostercare at the age of two. He was then passed from foster placement to foster placement until he finally went to live with Angelica and Gary McDonald when he was five. They fell in love with him even though they had already had two of their own biological children but they proceeded to adopt Hasan and still love him as their own to this day.
