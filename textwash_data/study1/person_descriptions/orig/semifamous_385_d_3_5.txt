Kenneth Lee Kramm was born in 1961 and was an American entrepreneur who had an amazing idea: adding flavouring to medicines to make them easier to take! He created a company called FLAVORx, based in Columbia, that supplied sugar-free, non allergenic and inert medicine flavourings and flavoring systems to pharmacies. The idea of adding flavourings to medicines came to his mind when his youngest daughter began suffering epileptic seizures when still a baby and refused to take ill-tasting medicines. He then developed proper flavourings that her little daughter liked and his invention was so great that was discovered by the nearby hospitals and made him famous.
