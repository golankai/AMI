Kenny Kramm is an American entrepreneur who lived a short but colourful life.  Leaving his job as an Art Director he decided to join his fathers pharmacy business.  He is famous for flavouring medicine so his daughter wouldn’t mind taking it.  She had epilepsy so it was vital she took her medicine.  It’s amazing to think how this is how FLAVORx started!!  Now kids can pick a candy flavoured medicine to suit their own taste, such a fantastic idea.  He was obviously a colourful character;  along with his father,  to think up such an idea as adding candy flavour to medicine so that is doesn’t taste so gross.
