Mick Jagger was born in the U.K. in 19xx and is/was the lead singer of the Rolling Stones. He has been married once and has had various other relationships. He has 8 children, 5 grandchildren and a great granddaughter. His relationship with bandmate Keith Richards has been described as a love hate relationship. The Rolling Stones are still very well known today and people all over the world buy their records. Mick Jagger is a patron of the Mick Jagger centre in Dartford and sponsors various music programs in schools locally. He is a Tory and supported Thatcher. He was also a supporter of David Cameron and voted in favour of Brexit, disappointingly, but later changed his mind, but by then it was a bit too late. I have no idea how many characters Iâ€™ve e written now - it feels like a lot.
