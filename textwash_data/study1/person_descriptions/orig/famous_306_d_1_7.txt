Daniel Radcliffe is most commonly known for playing Harry Potter in the movie series 'Harry Potter'. I think he is about 31 years old, he has brown hair and green eyes. He is around 165cm tall and has a slight beard/thick stubble. His hair is thick and fluffy, he wears glasses. He was born on the 23rd of July 1989, in London, England. My aunt used to live in the same apartment bit as him when I was about 9 years old. When he started filming Harry Potter he was 11 and finished filming the movie series when he was 22 years old. When he went on the tonight show or whatever it's called he rapped the alphabet song which was very impressive.
