William Bettendorf was a German- American inventor, who was born in 1857, and died in 1910. He invented a type of Plough, and metal wheel, and some other stuff, dying with 94 patents. His first wife was called Mary, and they had two children, Etta and Henry. After she did in 1901, he married his second wife in 1908.

He started building a family estate in Iowa, with the help of artisans from all over the world. Sadly he died a week before they were due to move in. His second wife died in 1926, and lived in their house until when, so definitely married well and reaped the benefits of his inventions.
