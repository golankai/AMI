William P Bettendorf was an American-German inventor. Although you probably havenâ€™t heard of him he invented some well known things!  Ie the power lift and by the age of 53 he held 94 patents-pretty impressive! He founded a company with his younger brother Joseph w Bettendorf called the Bettendorf Axle Company. Although he had a successful career his personal life was wracked with tragedy. With both his first wife and children dying before him. He himself died as his company was growing rapidly and before he had moved into the palatial home he was having built. Posthumously the city where he expired was named after him-Bettendorf,  Iowa, USA.
