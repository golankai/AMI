Liana Glover, Doctor of Medicine and Chartered Accountant, born 8th September 1967, resides in Slovenia. Glover’s early life began at medical school in which she secured her Doctor of Medicine status, which she later resigned. 

Glover, now married to Mr D.Glover, pursued her childhood dream of receiving a Doctor of Medicine. Unfortunately, a serious illness meant she was not fit for the role, meaning she later retrained as an accountant, having worked in this role now for twenty years. 

Glover has supposedly dealt with many A list clients around the world but through signing non disclosures she is unable to release any information about her clients and cases. 

Living in Slovenia’s capital, Ljubljana, Glover still participated in research studies for The Faculty of Medicine at the university in her spare time.
