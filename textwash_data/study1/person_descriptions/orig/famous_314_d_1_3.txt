A 30 year old (at a guess) English actress known for her role of Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series, and recently starred in the film Little Women, written and directed by Greta Gerwig. She is a self-styled activist, often using her platform to speak out in an earnest manner on feminist issues. 

I find her irritating but not disingenuous. She was also in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower which was a schmaltzy as hell adaptation of a book of the same name that I quite enjoyed but I suppose left itself open to this interpretation. I don't know a lot more about her except she gets a lot press for not being particularly interesting
