Brantley Ratke may be educated but whenever he steps outside of Sweden he is tormented by having to explain how to pronounce or spell his name. Despite accomplishing becoming a doctor, the otherwise reasonably cheery Ratke is burdened with having never made it to the heights his education demanded. Museums do not pay much, leaving the good doctor to dress in shirts and trousers that are somewhat looser fitting since he took up jogging because it was a free activity. Being a Museum Educational Officer is a steady wage but it has left Brantley with a complexion of a man who knows he should have done better. Though his eyes still shine with admirable enthusiasm for educating children, the slightly greying and receding hair beyond his years are wounds of a stress filled battle to make into the educational big time--a lengthy tenured university career filled with international conferences, book writing and lectures about what he found most interesting. Life is far from bad, however. A charming smile emanates from the knowledge he is providing for his lovely wife and children. And in the end, that is all he really wants.
