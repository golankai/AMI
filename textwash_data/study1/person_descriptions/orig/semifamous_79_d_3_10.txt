Irvin Brooks was an American baseball player. Born in a time when racial segregation and prejudice was the standard way of life, he struggled to be recognised through his own merits and was not afforded the opportunity to play with and against colleagues in the major baseball team.
His chance came by way of the creation of the Negro league; set up by another african american player who had had similar difficulties.
During this time, Irvin was able to not only play the sport he was so passionate about, but to standout from so many players as a real talent, capable of shining in many positions. 
His death in 1966 at the age of 74 years old, Irvin did not live to take part in the integrated leagues, but later generations would come to know of his contribution and in paving the way for so many future players of colour.
