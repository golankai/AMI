Dr. Brantley Ratke works closely with conservation groups in Uganda to educate museum visitors and tourists on the native wildlife and their environments. Occasionally, he also works in the field, helping the conservationists track down animals that may have been injured by hunters and poachers.

His busy work schedule means that he prefers staying in to going out whenever he gets any free time. He previously had a succession of girlfriends, mostly animal-lovers like himself. However, many of them had not been interested in, or patient about, his deeper conservation work. However, he has taken a shine to one of the museum's receptionists in recent weeks, although he does not reasonably see any relationship blossoming there.
