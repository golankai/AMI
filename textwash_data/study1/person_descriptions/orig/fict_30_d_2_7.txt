Mrs Liana Glover MD has had to work really hard all her life to get where she is today!
Growing up in Slovenia as a female was not easy at all. Women did not have the same oppertunities as men at the time of her growing up.
Her parents were very hardworking people. Which i believe gave her the drive and good work ethic that she has to this very day.
Liana works hard but plays hard to. Most people at the age of 53 are wanting to settle down. Not Liana!!
She married at a very young age, as that was the done thing at the time. But divorced after a couple years. She kept her married title because she thought it would help her on her carear path and it did, annoyingly!!
She is a warm,kind and genorous person.
