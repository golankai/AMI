This man sounds like he has some German parentage (Hermann) and maybe another such as Spanish as he lives in Spain. The fact he is a Jnr suggests his father had the same name unless he is trying to sound more important as  a marketing executive. At 44 he is probably showing signs of grey hair and maybe just moving past his peak performance. he is in a relationship - could be male or female. There is no suggestion of children. he may be gay or maybe divorced. As a marketing executive he is probably very self confident and maybe a bit flashy. I could imagine he wears casual clothes such as jeans even to important client meetings.
