He is a very famous actor in Hollywood who played batman. He's very accomplished person and has a unique way of carrying himself. I think he has played a drug addict in the past as well. He has also played the lead in various other films such as terminator, the big short, American psycho. I would say he is quite attractive too!! Initally I thought he was Australian but I think he is American. He is around 45 years old...maybe slightly older? He has dark hair and is Caucasian. I would be surprised if his name was a stage name as it sounds quite authentic. He put on a huskies voice than his own in batman and I believe he did many of his own stunts in the films.
