Ferd Homenick is a famous Belgian Dealer.  Famously having become a billionaire in the shortest possible time frame at a very young age he is a recognisable household name. Ferds' commercial success has afforded him the ability to give most generously to charity while he has also been busy as a play boy on the international stage for his entire adult life, He remains single and childless but continues to be seen with a string of beauties attached to his arm when out and about in high society circles. When we recently enquired about his next project Ferd insisted on secrecy but wanted to be sure that we checked back to help promote it when he is ready for it to launch.
