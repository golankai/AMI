Kenny Kramm, (full name Kenneth Lee Kramm) was an entrepeneur from America.

Kramm is known for founding FLAVORx, a company that supplies flavorings and flavoring systems to make medicines more palatable. 

Kramm's company was started after the birth of his daughter, Kelly. Kelly began suffering epileptic seizures that required her to take many doses of ill-tasting medicine. Kramm found it difficult to get Kelly to take her medicine and so began searching for ways to make it easier. He used candy flavourings and after experimenting with many different samples, Kelly eventually approved of one and it was later sold to pharmacies to be used more widely.
