Mrs. Glover is a Slovenian accountant who had quite a late change in career after training to be a doctor. She said she had been pressured into becoming a doctor by her parents and at the age of 40 decided she had had enough and wanted to follower her passion of accounting. It was because of of her change in career that she met her husband, Michael, who also had recently changed career; he had previously been a fighter pilot but, like Mrs. Glover, had always had a love for numbers. Liana and Michael adopted two children named James and Emily after a doctor confirmed Liana's infertility. Liana is now infinitely happier than when she was working as a doctor and now gives back to the community by volunteering at a local orphanage at the weekend.
