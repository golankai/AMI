After completing her undergraduate degree in Business Studies, Dr Hamill went on to do her Masters and Doctorate at Harvard University in the United States. Whilst there she met a wide number of people, and made a significant number of contacts. It was one of these contacts a few years later which reached out to her and offered her a position at Corporation Inc. - a new toothpaste company that was being set up in Ireland's capital. She accepted and gradually made her way up to the position of Chief Marketing Officer. She has appeared on various panels advocating for there to be more women in Business.
