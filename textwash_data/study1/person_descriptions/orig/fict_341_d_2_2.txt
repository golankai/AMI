Dr Dwaine O'Conner I happen to know very well personally as he used to catch the same bus as I did. 
He told me his job was that of a Hydrographic Surveyor, it seemed a very important role, well he told me it was and I took his word for it... 
He is in a relationship with Sarah sales, she is the local champion at bowls in the region.. That's where they met, they both have a mutual love for bowls. He used to describe his shear joy to me on the bus when he won a tough match, I could tell he was a big fan of the sport.. 
German in Nationality and 62 years of age, he was pleased to still be active in sport and said it helped keep him fit, that was important to him, keeping fit in his old age.
