Dr. Brantley Rake is a Museum Education Officer at the Natural History Museum. He specialises in big cats. His upbringing in Africa brought him into close contact with lions which remain his lifelong passion. He is married to Dr. Penny Dartford who also works at the museum. They often collaborate on displays and projects with a focus on education and conservation in developing nations. They do a lot for charity; fund-raising for Rake's village in Uganda where they have contributed to the building of toilet blocks, schools and a village hall with sports track. Their ultimate aim is to build a museum out there and move there to do so.
