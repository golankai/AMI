He is a professional footballer who plays for Mumbi Fc which is probably a reasonable Indian football club. He has represented India at football at a younger age. Football is popular in India and I imagine he played alot in the streets before being seen and brought into a more formal setting to play. He is probably very fit having played football from a young age. he may well have a high status in India as they like their sport and particularly anyone who does well for them. In Indian terms he is probably wealthy. He will have typical Indian characteristics of dark hair and may be shorter than the UK average male height. He may well have a beard too.
