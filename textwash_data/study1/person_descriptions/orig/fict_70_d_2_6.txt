Rinda likes her coffee strong and bitter. No sugar added, because diabetes runs in her family, and at her age, she doesn't want to risk it. Rinda met her husband, Ben Schuster, during a singles party. They were both dragged there unwillingly by friends who did not want to go to the single party alone. They hit it off when they realized that they were the only ones standing by the bar looking extremely bored, and enjoyed a shared interest in how lame the entire idea was. Her days consist of dreaming of her upcoming retirement with Ben, as they decided on buying a holiday house in Spain together - and trying to ignore the clearly jealous employee who's trying his best to ensure he takes over her job once she's retired.
