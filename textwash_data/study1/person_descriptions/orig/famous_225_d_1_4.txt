Elton john is a late 50's gentleman, slightly over weight, small in height for a man, wears a wig, caucasian and has blue eyes I think. He is known for wearing flamboyant outfits and is an incredible artist and has worked extremely hard his whole life. He is a very generous man and has helped lots of charities with tasing funds. The artist in him has been known to be a national treasure and has MBE or OBE I believe. Further more Elton John is openly gay and was one of the first in the music industry to be open about his sexuality, he is married and has adopted two boys. The most important thing about Elton John is his incredible talent, he co writes a lot of his work mainly melodies and not the lyrics. He is also a great entertainer and has such stage presence and aura.
