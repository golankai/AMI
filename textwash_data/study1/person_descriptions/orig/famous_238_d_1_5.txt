He is a very, very old British man. He is tall and slim. Lots of children spread over many decades. Lots of famous lovers. No idea of his social or political views. I think he has a cockney accent. No idea what country he lives in currently. I don't buy his music. Singer and front-man of the Rolling Stones one of the most successful British bands ever. I imagine that he has broken records for number of sales. He was married to supermodel Jerry Hall who is now married to newspaper magnate Rupert Murdoch. I believe there is a Rolling Stones shop opening up in London with the lips and tongue symbol.
