Kenny Kramm - a spoonful of sugar.
Kenny Kramm was an American entrepreneur who is famous for making medicine more palatable for children after his own daughter refused to take her epilepsy medication. 
Kenny originally trained in advertising, working as an art director before joining his father's pharmaceutical company as a business manager.
It was in fact Kenny's father, Harold, who first suggested the idea of sweetening the medicine to help the girl, and the men worked together to find a solution, eventually turning the idea into the successful business FLAVORx.
Kenny was born in Washington in 1961 and died of sepsis in 2016.
