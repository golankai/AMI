Dr. Brantley Ratke was originally born in Germany to an American father and native German mother. In his youth, he was known for his elaborate and complex booby-traps that he would set up around the local village. By the age of 12, Ratke and his family were forced out of Germany into exile. He did not particularly care for this turn of events, and sought to distance himself from a family that held back his booby-trap creation escapades. Wandering from town to town and country to country for several years, Ratke found a new passion in education. Beginning to work in a museum first as a cleaner, he was noticed by the Director of the museum writing educational material on blackboards when he should have been working. This was the inspiration for the film Good Will hunting. Laterlly, Ratke has been trying to find a boyfriend, but has had little success, primarily because his only experience of relationships was with an unfortunate milkmaid in one of the towns he wandered through as a youth.
