Hasan Daniel is Male and lives in Canada. He is thirty one years old and his occupation is as a consulting civil engineer. He is in a long term relationship with his girlfriend Amelia who is twenty eight and works as a primary school teacher. They met when they were travelling in Thailand and Amelia relocated from England to Canada three years ago so they could be together. They plan to marry next year and would love to have children, at the moment they have two cats named Peanut and Pumpkin and they look forward to adding to their family soon. They live in a cosy old ranch style home and love to ride their horses and take care of their goats and chickens. They spend their weekends hiking, curling up in front of the fire, or catching up with their friends and Hasan's family who live about an hour away.
