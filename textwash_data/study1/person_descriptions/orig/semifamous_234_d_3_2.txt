William P. Bettendorf was a prolific 19th century German-American inventor. In his short life he held almost one hundred patents. The most widely used of these include, but are not limited to the power lift sulky plow and the Bettendorf metal wheel.

Born in Illinois, his family moved to Missouri, where his father ran a grocers, then on to Kansas. William was educated in a school that was primarily for Native Americans, despite being German-American. 

William married Mary Wortman in 1879 and together they had two children, a boy and a girl named Henry and Etta. Then Mary died, so he married Eliabeth Staby. Her husband had died, so they probably bonded over a mutual hatred of death.
