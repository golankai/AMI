Benedict Cumberbatch is a world-renowned English actor who was born in London, England in 1976.
His career has seen him develop from a TV actor into a Hollywood leading man.
He has played a variety of roles from critically acclaimed movies such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, 12 Years a Slave, through to voice over work on The Grinch.
He is most recognisable for his portrayal as Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
Cumberbatch has also tread the boards of theatre world on more than one occasion.
I would describe him as a fairly straight-laced actor and it is may be a reflection of him or the roles that he plays but the characters come across as rather emotionless or boring.
That said I have enjoyed a number of his movies but sometimes one has to be in the mood to sit down and watch one of his more serious portrayals.
