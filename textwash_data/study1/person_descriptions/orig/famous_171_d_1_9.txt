Someone who was embroiled in a sex scandal in the 90s. He has starred in a number of romantic films which has led to him being fairly typecast. He recently starred in Paddington film which felt like a bit of a money grab exercise. His dalliance into politics has been viewed cynically given his earlier sex scandal.
He is a white male, dark hair, well spoken. He is famous both here in the UK and the USA. I would estimate his age to be in the mid to late 50s and at one point he grew a goatee. My favourite film that I saw him in was the gentlemen, where he adopted a Cockney accent. I don't have positive feeling for him as he comes across as quite arrogant and entitled, however this isn't an opinion I share widely as he isn't a relevant topic of conversation amongst my peer group.
