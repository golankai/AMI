Doctor Brantley Ratke was born in Nairobi, Kenya on 13 of December 1982. His mother was a seamstress and his father worked in tea industry.
Ratke became interested in history and museums after his parents took him to visit family in Paris. On this trip to Paris he became enamoured with The Louvre, so much so that he apparently snuck out at night so he could go and visit it.
After graduation from high school, Ratke went to study Anthropology at Oxford University. While studying here, he was provided the opportunity to complete a years work placement in the USA working at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He graduated Oxford University with a 2:1, and decided to move to Uganda. He currently works at the Musuem of Africa.
