Liana is a hard worker as she is a charted accountant so she has earned her way up in the working world. She seems to be career-focused and has earned herself MD after her name. She is also relationship-oriented which must be nice as she is in her 50s so getting to spend time with another person romantically is good. She stays in Slovenia so she is part of an amazing culture which would impact her significantly.  As her surroundings are mainly of nature and beautiful architecture she may feel at peace with little stress. Her job as an accountant would be quite stressful, so being able to leave the office and walk through the beautiful country would rest her mind.
