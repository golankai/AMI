I would imagine Dr. Brantley Ratke as an educated man who values career over personal life, due to the fact that he is single at the age of 37. 
He is a relatively young black man who is incredibly intelligent due to his doctorate status. Additionally, he has spent many years in education to achieve that status and therefore is experienced in education, making him suitable for the role of museum education officer.
I imagine he would be rather boring due to the stereotype of museums being boring and therefore their staff would be too. Although this may be a very unfair assumption to make. 
Living in Uganda there is a very rich history and therefore a lot to be in museums and to educate the public about, therefore he must be very good at his job and be knowledgeable about the history of Uganda.
