Walter K. Chorn was a great football player and lawyer. He had always been a kid interested in extra-curricular activities but he was also interested in arguments from a very young age. He always beat everybody at arguments, he thought this was probably because of his parent's divorce and the constant bickering that he had to listen to in the house. He read a lot from a very young age and hence could not fathom why his parents were constantly fighting about menial issues. He often had arguments with himself before he went to sleep regarding issues he had overheard his parents discussing. This was also the reason he liked spending time away from home in the mornings when he escaped with his friends to play football any chance that he got.
