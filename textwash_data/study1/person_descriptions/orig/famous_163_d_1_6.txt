Adele is a famous singer in her 30s. Shes a beautiful young woman with a gorgeous voice. She has a beautiful smile and often has light brunette hair. She was born and raised in the UK, mainly London. She experienced a vocal cord hammorage during her career forcing her to cancel tours and rest her voice to prevent permanant damage. Id say Adele's fan base has a decent age range, but her music tends to gravitate beyond teenagers and young adults to older asults. She sings a lot of slow and sometimes dreary songs, and the subject of these songs is often love and relationships. Her most famous song is probably someone like you. She tops the charts often and tends to hold onto her place in said charts. I have not herd a lot about her in the news recently except for her impressive weight loss. From interviews she seems to be kind and gentle. She has won many mnay awards for her music.
