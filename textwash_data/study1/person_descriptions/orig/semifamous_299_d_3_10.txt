He played many different positions such as pitcher, infielder, and outfielder. He batted and threw both on his right arm. Brooks spent his career with the Brooklyn Royal Giants and was an outstanding hitter. Cumberland Posey, the influential owner of the Homestead Grays, named Brooks to his all-time Negro league baseball all-star team.
