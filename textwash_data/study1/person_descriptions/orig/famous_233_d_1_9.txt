English actor most notable for his roles in romantic comedies, including the Brigitte Jones films, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and Love Actually. Generally noted for being funnier than a squirrel in a cage full of terriers, Hugh Grant is loved the world over by his legions of adoring fans. Though in his fifties, he still commands the attention of numerous members of the ‘fairer’ sex, and more than a few of his own. Hugh has a family - probably - though I don’t really care. He was born to wealthy parents in [some place in England], educated at the highly esteemed Institute of Squirrel Lovers, where he studied Advanced Alchemy in the hope of learning how to turn soil into platinum.
