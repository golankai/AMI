Emma Watson is a famous actress.  She is best known for appearing in the Harry Potter movies in which she played Hermione.  She is an activist of women's rights and continues to act in various films.  I understand she was a model when she was young as well as an actress and appeared in Vogue.  Amongst her films post Harry Potter perhaps the most famous is Beauty and the Beast in which she recreates the role of Belle who falls in love with the Beast.  Emma Watson is regularly voted one of the most beautiful women and yet also is strongly supportive of women's rights and ensuring women are treated equally across the world.
