Sir Mick Jagger is an English singer and known for being one of the founding members of The Rolling Stones.
Mick Jagger has a very recognisable voice which, along with Keith Richards on the guitar, made The Rolling Stones one of the greatest bands of all time. 
Mick is known for his shaggy haircut and alternative clothing. Personally, I think that Harry Styles takes quite a lot of influence from him. 
Mick has been married a couple of times. The one that springs to mind for me is Jerry Hall. I think he was also married to L'wren Scott who committed suicide. 
He has quite a few children, perhaps 6 or 7, I think some of them are into reality television.
