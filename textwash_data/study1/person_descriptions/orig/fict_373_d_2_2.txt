Dr Dwain O'conner came to my attention when it was reported in a British newspaper that a British man who had been living in Germany had been arrested by the Russian police service. The Russians said that Dr O,connor was not a hydrographic surveyor as he stated when interviewed but in fact a British spy. Dr O'connor's patner Adolf Schmidt said the whole thing was very upsetting as Dr O'connor, age 62, suffered from nose bleeds when in a stressful situation and Mr Schmidt was very concerned for Dr O'connors health. Mr Schidt also added that Dwain would never dream of spying on another country and all these allegations from the Russians was rubbish. The British consulate said they would look into the matter but did not have high hopes.
