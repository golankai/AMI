Dr Ratke joined the cultural sector as a museum education officer following a distinguished early career teaching in Montessori schools. Their interest in the progressive, independent teaching method was sparked during their studies at Oxford, where their DPhil in Experimental Psychology brought them into contact with the Oxford Montessori School group. Dr Ratke believes that application of the founding principles of the Montessori method could revolutionise the engagement of children and young people with museum collections, often considered a 'hard to reach' audience. Currently working with Skansen, the world's oldest open-air museum, their hands on approach to engagement and learning fits well with the Dr Ratke's innovative education offer and the museum has seen a significant increase in bookings through both their schools and outreach programme.
