Hugh Grant is an actor, he was in Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love, Actually. He is also remembered for getting caught with a prostitute, which slightly damaged his career. Recently, he has worked with Guy Ritchie and seems to be getting his career back on track. He is English, and probably the most stereotypical English man alive, as he is a reference point for many Americans due to their familiarity with his roles. In Love, Actually, he played the UK Prime Minister. His career does not really say much about his acting ability as most of the roles are mainstream crowd pleasers, so the audience does not often get to see him be challenged by the characters, leading to his status as just a 'leading man' rather than a great actor like some of his contemporaries.
