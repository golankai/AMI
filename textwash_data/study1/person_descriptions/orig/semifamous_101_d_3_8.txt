Aleksandr Grysakin was born on 23rd August 1974 and became a professional football player in 1992 when he signed for CSKA Moscow.  He made 84 appearances for CSKA and then moved to Hapoel Bat Yam F.C. in 1996 before moving on to FC Saturn Ramenskoye in 1996 where he played for 4 years from 1996 to 2000, his longest period with a club. During his 13 year career he played for nine different clubs, but only staying for one season in most clubs. 
Aleksandr had difficulty settling in teams after Saturn, where he had very much been the star scorer for the team. In each subsequent club his role was more of a supporting one but he often tried to be a  star striker and frequently found himself at odds with his managers and team mates.
Off the pitch he was a renowned playboy, often being photographed at nigh clubs and society parties and always with beautiful female escorts. In spite of this rumours often circulated that he was attracted to men and he often found himself being mocked from the stands. 
In 2008, three years after retirement, he outed himself as gay and criticised the football league for its homophobia. He now works as a gay activist in Moscow
