Hugh Grant is a very famous English actor born on 9 September 1960 and he has won several important prizes across his career. His movies are mainly comedies (especially romantic comedies) and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is one of his most famous and amazing works. He is a very good looking, charming actor and has a contagious smile. Bridget Jones's Diary is another big success and was an international hit, earning $281 million worldwide. His acting appears very spontaneous and I believe this is the reason why it's loved by the public. Grant is now 60 years old and he is still fully immersed in acting.
