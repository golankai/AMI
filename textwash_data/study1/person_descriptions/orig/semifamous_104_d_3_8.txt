After making his professional debut for PFC CSKA-d Moscow in 1992, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Gryazin went on to play for a string of Russian football teams until 2005 when he signed for FC Spartak-MZhK Ryazan but failed to make any appearances for the club. Now retired, the 46-year-old stands at an unimpressive 1.80 metres tall. During his professional career, this will not have helped with his lacklustre goal-scoring record. The midfielder/striker scored only 54 goals in 297 professional appearances for all of his clubs.
This footballer shares a birthday with he late, great Kobe Byrant who, as athletes go, was by far this man's superior.
