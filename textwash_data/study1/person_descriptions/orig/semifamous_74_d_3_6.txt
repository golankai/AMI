Malcolm dunstan often likes having lunch on a lawn instead of playing a real sport (cricket isn't a sport). He has a medium bowl because no cricketers are athletic enough to bowl fast. He's so unimportant that he has no pictures I can find of him at all. He has no loyalty to a team/always gets kicked off the team. His top score of all time is 52 which isn't great which might explain the lack of photos. He caught the ball four times in one match which might be impressive in football(if your not a goal keeper) but not really in cricket. He is a bit weird and has 2 middle names, Malcolm Stephen Thomas dunstan.
