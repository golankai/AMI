Kenny Kramm was an American father of a child with a life treathening disease who decided to step up and make the life of his daughter and all children in a similar condition easier. When his infant daughter refused to take her daily medicine due to its unpalatable taste, Kenny Kramm started looking for a way to mask the bitter taste, and improve palatability by adding the same kind of flavours candy makers use. The task wasn't easy at the beginning, but Kenny had always been a resolute and inventive man and managed to get the compounds he needed in the dosage he needed. He was helped by his father who run the  small farmacy firm where Kenny was employed as business manager.    After the first success with his daughter, Kenny thought that so many other children were in the same condition, and so many parents were as worried and as helpless as him, so he decided to found a small business specialised in supplying taste modulators for pediatric and veterinary medicines. He was helped in the endeavour by his father, who was a pharmacist, and made a success of the new business thanks to his skills in advertising. He originally trained in advertising design and was a skilful painter. He also enjoyed hiking, and was well beloved in his local community. Sadly when he was only 55 years old he contracted sepsy and died.
