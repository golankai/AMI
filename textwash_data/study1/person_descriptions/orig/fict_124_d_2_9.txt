A 17th century Flemish Baroque painter and art dealer based in Antwerp. He established art dealing business with international connections in Europe maintained by his extended family. He originally trained as a painter and cabinet maker but built a reputation through his international art business. His children became art dealers who settled in various cities in Europe such as Venice, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Linz, Passau and Cadiz where they supplied an elite clientele with a variety of art objects. 

When in the 1670s Flanders suffered a severe economic downturn due mostly to an invasion by the French, Ferd and his brother became art entrepreneurs by hiring lesser painters to create group projects such as large commissioned copies of famous works or large decorative objects.
