malcom dunstan is a minor counties cricketer who is 6foot5 with black hair and a dragon tattoo on his neck he was a wonderful cricketer but his bad boy image got in the way of his talent he used to bet against his own team then play really well this tactic cost him alot of money with bookies that by the time he retired at the age of 39 he was Â£490000 in debt to a man you dont want to be in debt to despite this the debt is not the reason he retired the truth is during a one day game malcom hit a ball that was going for six but as it went up it hit a bird sending it to an untimely death unable to live with the guilt of what the sport had turned him into he retired and opened a bird sanctuary in the Scottish islands where the bad people cant find him and trust me they're looking he now lives there with his life partner Dennis and there adopted son Tarquin  he now has a fear of balls and bats
