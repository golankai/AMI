Irvin Brooks was an American baseball player in the early 1900s. He was born in Key West, Florida and was also known as Chester. 

Irvin was an outstanding hitter and is known to this day as being one of the best in his field, no pun intended! 

Irvin grew up as a single child, without any brothers or sisters and as such, carved his baseball skills with school friends and wider family, often playing with his cousins at the weekend between shifts at the local bakery. 

Irvin met his wife at the bakery and married her on 1st January 1933. Together they had 5 children, Katy, Katherine, Kai, Keely and Keith. All five children went on to have a huge interest in baseball, like their father.
