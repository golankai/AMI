William P. Bettendorf was a German inventor, born in Illinois, USA. William Bettendorf was educated in a total of 12 public schools due to constantly getting told off and excluded about his inability to concentrate and fighting with fellow pupils. Williamsâ€™ parents struggled to find a school that would accept him with his bad record and this led to a breakdown in their marriage. Eventually one of his schools, St. Mary's Mission School in Kansas, put him on a strict learning programme, with him often not being allowed to mix with the other children and he managed to pass. He found employment as a machinist's apprentice and during this time he invented the first ever power lift sulky plow in 1878 for which he is still credited for till this day.
