Aleksandr Gryazin is a retired Russian professional footballer. He retired reluctantly as he enjoyed his job a great deal. He perhaps carried on playing longer than he should have done as his game and health deteriorated prior to his retirement. He now has a long term leg injury which causes him excessive pain and issues with his mobility and sleep. He has put on weight since retiring and comfort eats when he is in pain. He is happily married to his wife Irina. They have no children but are close to their siblings who have children and Aleksandr and Irina dote on them. Aleksandr is currently giving thought to what he wants to do with the rest of his life now he is retired as he feels somewhat unfulfilled.
