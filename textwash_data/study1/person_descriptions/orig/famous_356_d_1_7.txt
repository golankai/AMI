A decent actor overshadowed by his fame as a child actor for Harry Potter. Very British, a gentleman and studious. Hardworking and a polite person. Independent and free to do as he wishes. Another child actor who grew up in a environment where he was exposed to too much as he suffers from alchol addiction. He appears to be caring and philanthropic. Furthermore, he is very charitable and greatful. Appears to be a nice person to talk to and converse with. A very famous person but overall a regular guy. Down to earth and genuine. Appears to be a calm and collected person. Tall and average looking. His fashion sense isn't very amazing as he appears simple dressed down with the dull colours.
