Hugh Grant is a british actor most know for his role as William in the romantic movie Notting Hill, his roles are usually ""the boyfriend"" in most movies and e can really show emotional and meant every word in each role. I think he is a great representation of what is a good person in the movie industry, plus he's a figure that represents the talent of british actors and artists. Physically he is always well presented and I always thought of him as a portrait of what a charming men should be. He has a dark hair color, with some grey undertones, green eyes, he's always smiling that probably means that he is a happy guy, but you never know.
