Aleksandr Gryazin is a retired Russian professional footballer.  Although never a record-breaker in terms of first-team appearances or in representing his country, he was a respected midfielder who produced solid and stolid performances, mainly in teams few outside of Russia have heard of, mentored young players and epitomised the character of his league.

Now in his mid-40s, by all accounts, that is by the appearance of no accounts, he seems to have settled in to relative obscurity. However, those who know him can confirm that he is now very much the modern househusband, rewarding the loyalty of his partner whose sacrifices enabled him to gallivant around Russia kicking his opponents rather more often than kicking a ball.
