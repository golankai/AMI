Rinda Schuster was born 1951 in Apartheid era South Africa to a Frederrick and Amanda Shuster. From a young age it was apparent she was skilled at negotiating. Convincing her parents, to be more lenient with punishments. This led her to enjoying debating at school and then college, volunteering to be part of the Debate Society in her first year of college. 

Her father worked in a mine, as many people still do to this day in South Africa, although not usually a high paying career, her father Fredderick, known as ""Bobby"" to his friends quickly climbed up the ranks from a miner, to the mine manager. This let Fredderick pay for a very nice and comfortable college stay for his daughter in her youth. 

Today Rinda lives and is retired in England, United Kingdom, maintaining a strong South African tradition of retiring in the UK or Australia. 

She is Afrikaans Boer (White South African) in heritage and her first language is Afrikaans although she is fluent in English as a second language. 

She spent most of her working life in sales, using her negotiating skills to convince people how to spend their hard earned cash. 

When she was 32 she married an Alistair Hunter, who she met while on holiday in Greece. They divorced 3 years later and Alistair left South Africa. Rinda never did find love again.
