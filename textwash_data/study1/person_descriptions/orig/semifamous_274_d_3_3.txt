Yassime was born in 1990 the son of a famous football player Hajjaj. He quickly picked up his interest for football and was signed by the youth team la louvieve. By 16 he was scouted by the English football Birmingham City but the transfer did not follow through as he was priced too high. He made his debut with la louviere but left for Gent soon after. He played a number of other games for different teams in his youth and became a fine passer of the ball. He moved lots more teams over the years. Eventually he became  a pro level but unfortunately received a penalty and a criminal record after being caught for reckless driving in June 2016.
