Dr Brantley Ratke is a respected academic and also works in a museum to help fund further studies.  He may be single, but mainly because he dedicates most of his time to his work and career.  Aged 37 he has published over 20 articles in leading scientific journals in his specific area of knowledge relating to dinosaurs.  In 2019 Dr. Brantley Ratke was nominated for the highest science award possible in his home country of Sweden which he was subsequently shortlisted in the top five and came second to another colleague that has been in his field for around 10 years more.  No doubt he will eventually win this award if he contiues to grow as he has done so far in this field.
