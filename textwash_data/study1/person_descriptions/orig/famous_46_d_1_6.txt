She is a talented singer-songwriter who channeled the emotions from her heartbreak towards producing her record-breaking album, 21, released in 2011. She later brought her typical British humour and sass to the American public when she appeared on various talk shows, namely on the James Corden segment, Carpool Karaoke. Most recently, she resurfaced from a long break from the public eye and showcased impressive weight loss on her latest Instagram post. Adele also has a hidden talent for rap, which she is quite modest about - despite there being many instances of her spitting bars on the internet, she has yet to do so on her commercial albums.
