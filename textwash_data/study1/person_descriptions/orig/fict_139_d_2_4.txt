Dr. Ratke was born in an impoverish part of Uganda.

As a child he took an intrest in ancient artifacts after finding remnants of clay pots burried near his village. Although these were not very old or an important discovery, they did get him very excited and from then on, he pursued a career in arachaelogy. 

He put himself through school by working three jobs as a child and eventually gained a scholarship to study in America when he was only 16. 

He graduated and followed a career as an Archaelogists. He enjoyed being front and centre in digs but after an injury to his back, he was no longer able to be in the front lines.

He returned to school and earned his PHD in Education and is now employeed at the Smithsonian as a Museum Education Officer.
