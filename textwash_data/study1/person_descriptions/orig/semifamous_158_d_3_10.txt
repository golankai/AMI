Irvin Woodberry Brooks (5th June 1891 - 4th February 1966) was an American baseball player. Whereas he was actually born in Florida several reference books incorrectly list him as being born in the Bahamas.

Between 1918 to 1933 he played as a pitcher, second base and outfielder for the Brooklyn Royal Giants. He was also an outstanding hitter and was named in the all-time Negro League all-star baseball team. Brooks was easily good enough to play Major League Baseball however, he was prevented from doing so due to segregation rules.

He was married and had three children one of whom Marvin went on to become a leading civil rights activist who was a close personal friend of Martin Luther King.
