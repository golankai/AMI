Irvin Brooks was born in Key West Florida in 1891 and he died in 1966.
He was a player in the american baseball team 'the Nero leagues', and from 1918 to 1933 he played in the team as pitcher, infielder and outfielder.
His nickname was 'Chester' which is sometime thought to be his actual name, but it was only a nickname that refers to his west Indian origins. It is thought that Irvin Brooks was the grandson of a west Indian immigrant.
The Brooklyn Royal Giants was his main team and this is where his career flourished. 
Apparently he was a really great batsman.
He was a smartly dressed person and a photo obtained of him shows him attired in a suit and tie, with a camel overcoat, neatly buttoned up, and belted at the waist, with polished shoes and a smart trendy hat. He is also carrying a cane.
