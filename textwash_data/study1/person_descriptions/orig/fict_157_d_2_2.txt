Okay so I imagine Dr Dwaine to be a silver fox - very attractive and having had a colourful life he is now a professional and accomplished person. He is one of 4 children and has 4 daughters himself who are all also very academic. His daughters have travelled the world and are now either doctors or in anthropology. His eldest daughter is probably a neo-natal surgeon. He is no longer with his daughters mother, her name is Dolores but they are very good friends. He has a younger wife called Molly who doesn't work and doesn't need to. Dwaine owns a boat and lives in Palm Beach at the weekends and Manhattan during the week. He works on the upper East side.
