Clyde Fernandes is a 26 years old professional footballer. He is Indian, born in Mumbai. The Mumbai Football Club is also the team where he made is professional debut four years ago, in 2016. He currently plays in the Ozone Football Club team as a defender, he joined this team in 2018. In 2010, he went to Sounth Africa to play India against Egypt in the under-16 category, they won 13-1. I don't know what else to say about him as I have never heard his name before and I am alsno not a fan of football and I follow news related to it at all. I don't know what else to write to get to the 600 characters.
