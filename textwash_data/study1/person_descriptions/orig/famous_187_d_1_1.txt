Benedict Cumberbatch has dark hair and blue eyes, he has distinct facial features and pale skin, sometimes he can be described as 'a weird crush' because he is not conventionally good looking but people find him alluring and attractive. I think this might be to do with the character he plays Sherlock Holmes who is brilliant, clever yet eccentric. Benedict is tall and slim and a talented actor. There are not many people who look like him, he is quite unique in his appearance. His face always seems quite serious and he has a certain 'poshness' about him.  I imagine his personality to be similar to his character of Sherlock Holmes, but I think thats just because I have watched a lot of it and dont really see much in the tabloids of his real personality. Again his name makes me think he is posh.
