Dr Hamill started working for the company in 1980 following gaining a bachelors degree in Media from Warwick University.  She then started in the marketing department as an intern and slowly worked her way through the organisation becoming Head of Marketing in 1990.  Following her MBA, she then completed her doctorate in 2001 from University College Dublin looking at how customers in developing countries react to online advertising.  Dr Hamill was then appointed Chief Marketing Officer in 2007 and has held the post ever since.  In her spare time, Dr Hamill enjoys spending time with her family, long walks in the countryside, the occasional prozac, staring into the distance wondering why she is still working for the same company after all of these years, cooking and looking after her dog, Bonzo.  Dr Hamill is looking forward to retirement and developing a borderline drinking problem.
