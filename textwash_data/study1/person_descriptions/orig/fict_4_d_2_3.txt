Hasan is a consulting civil engineer who has worked from the age of 21 to work up to his current job role. Hasan has been work focused and this has distracted him from his life goals of a relationship and a family until the age of 31. Hasan moved to Canada at the age of 28 to further his career and to hope to meet the man to settle down with. Hasan met many men through a dating app however was unsuccessful. Hasan met the man who he now sees as his soul mate, Jason at a local dog show. Hasan now looks to adopt a child to complete their family (along with the current love of their life, Rory the Cocker Spaniel!).
