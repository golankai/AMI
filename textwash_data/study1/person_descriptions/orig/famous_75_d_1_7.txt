Most people know Daniel Radcliffe as the main character from the films 'Harry Potter', he played Harry. He is an English actor who basically become so famous and popular from these Harry Potter films, but he has been in other stuff too, like a Horror film I watched a few years back called The Woman in Black, it wasn't great. Acting wise I'd say Daniel is good and well known. He is in his twenties or early thirties and has dark brown shaggy hair. He recently got into a bit of a twitter feud with JK Rowling and in general he seems quite nice as he contributes to charities and seems to speak out of behalf of others. He is probably one of the top paid actors there is but he doesn't seem very rich, he has remained a bit grounded.
