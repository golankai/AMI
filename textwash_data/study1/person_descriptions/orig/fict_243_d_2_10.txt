Amelie Crooks is a 42 year old Irish woman, who currently resides in Austria and works as an IT trainer for a non profit organisation. 
She has 2 children with an ex partner Nelson Booth: the CEO of Bronze Bust, an independent publishing house based in London. 

Crooks was born in Bantry, Co Cork and was one of five siblings raised by their single mother. Amelie's youngest brother is convicted con-artist Sean Crooks. Sean was convicted for conning Bronze Bust out of Â£3.78 million pounds between the period 2013-2015.  Amelie has never spoken on record about her brother's arrest despite numerous tabloid papers offering her large sums of money for her story. 

Before moving to Austria Crooks worked as a Personal Assistant to author Margaret Farmer. It is believed Crooks' move to Austria was in part due to Farmer's decision to move to Austria, however shortly after both women moved they ended their professional relationship with one another.
