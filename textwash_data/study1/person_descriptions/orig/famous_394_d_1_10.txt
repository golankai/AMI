A young singer born in London with a lovely distinctive voice.  He is six foot two inches and was over weight but has slimmed down.  Quietly spoken, he has had several hit songs and has been on the music scene since 2007.  He has won many awards for his music.  Also he co wrote and sang on the James Bond film Spectre.  He is twenty-four and his birthsign is Taurus and chinese sign Monkey. His middle name is Frederick.  In May 2014 he made it public that he is gay.  His debute album was called In The Lonley Hour.  Has quite alot of loyal fans.  My personal favourite single of his is Writings on he Wall.
