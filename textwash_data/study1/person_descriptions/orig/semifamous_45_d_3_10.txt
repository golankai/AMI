Irvin Brooks was an American baseball player who lived from 1891 - 1966.   He played in the Negros leagues as black people where not allow to play on the same team or against while players during this time.   He was born in Key West, Florida.  His parents, Maria and Austin were former slaves turned slave owners and owned a small plantation which provided them with a modest income that enabled the family to live a happy and successful life.  Irvin started playing baseball at the young age of 8 years old.  He was watching a group of older boys playing and wanted to join in.  They wouldn't let him at first.  They said that if he made lemonade for them every day for a whole month then he could join in.  Not one to be deterred, Irvin made the lemonade every day day for the whole month so the boys let him play.  Luckily Irvin was tall for his age and he was a good catcher.  So he started playing.  He played for his school team and was spotted by a talent scout at the age of 16 and thus began the start of his career.
