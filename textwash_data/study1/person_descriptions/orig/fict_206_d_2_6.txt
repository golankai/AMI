Rinda Schuster is a 69 year old Sales Executive from London, England. She lives with her husband, Billy Bob, and their twelve children in a leafy suburb and, when she's not crunching the numbers in the office, spends her time waterskiing, knitting jumpers for homeless penguins and abseiling. Looking at Rinda, you wouldn't suspect much; her formerly blonde hair is greying, she has wrinkles around her once bright, engaging eyes and she is frequently told be her eldest daughter that her clothes belong back in the 80s. However, there is more than meets than eye when it comes to Rinda Schuster. Several years ago, Rinda was scouted by MI5 for the aforementioned ordinariness of her appearance and now, spends at least two weeks out of the year assisting the British government spy on the Russians. She has been invited in to the Kremlin only once but don't expect her to crack this story out at dinner parties, she is the erstwhile professional!
