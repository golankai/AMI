Irivin Brooks was a successful and famous baseball player with the Brooklyn Royal Giants in America, during the segregation years of the 1920's and 30's.

From all accounts he was a talented, determined player and an outstanding hitter; much admired throughout his career and beyond. He was also a role model for many African Americans who saw through his success a path to a sporting career of their own. Many current African American baseball players, and even sports people in other areas cite him as the inspiration for their own career.

Unfortunately in the current febrile, racist atmosphere of America it is more important than ever to highlight people such as Irvin Brooks so those still fighting for racial equality have hope and positivity to give them strength.
