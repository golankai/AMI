Hermann is a friendly but work-focused person who cares about  his family and his stressful but rewarding job. He loves relaxing by the beach with his wife and 2 dogs and also loves cooking delicious hot and spicy dishes at the weekends. Hermann has a very quirky hobby: he flys light-weight planes for which he obtained a pilot licence when he was 21. He doesn't have a huge income so he can't afford flying a rented plane very often, but he thoroughly enjoys those moments whenever he's able to as they are his own times - in the sky, by himself meditating his life. He occasionally takes trips abroad with his close relatives and enjoys the outdoor activities offered in the various resorts. He loves gardening and growing his own vegetables in his back garden.
