Hasan Daniel is a 31 year old from Canada. He is married to a model from New Zealand, Ashley Verian. Together they own a civil engineering empire which they manage between them and Hasan is a consultant at. 

Hasan was born and raised in a sleepy village in England, called Oxbarton. He grew up with two brothers and a sister, all younger than him. As a child he learned how to play the guitar and has taught many musicians that have gone on to be in bands such as One Direction and Little Mix. This is a talent Hasan put aside when he met his partner and began to build their business. 

As a teenager, Hasan studied at Oxford University before winning a scholarship at a university in Canada, Greymont. It was at this uni he met Ashley. 

Of the many awards and accolades Hasan has earned, his most loved is the one he has for being patron saint of the Make A Wish Foundation. Hasan spends a lot of time, money and effort on visiting sick children in hospital and making their dreams and wishes come true.
