Dr. Brantley Ratke is a museum education officer whom spends most of his days giving tours of the Brisitish National History Museum to school children and small private groups. He cares greatly about giving the best experience possible to visitors because he has such a passion for history and all the exhibits within the museum. He is originally from Uganda and worked extremely hard to be awarded a scholership to study history with the british museum of natural history. Since arriving in England Dr. Ratke has been awarded a masters and a doctorate in his work but opted to bow out of history educationally to become the official museum educators. He works closely with interns from different universities and is head of the mentorship program within the museum.
