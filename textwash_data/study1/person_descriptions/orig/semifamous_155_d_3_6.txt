Malcolm Dunstan, who was born in Cornwall in 1950, is a retired English cricketer. He played for numerous local teams, principally as a batsman (right-handed) with his most notable score was a single 'half century' coming in at a mere 52 runs. Dunstan has also played against foreign teams which had come on a tour around Englands cricket grounds - specifically he played against the Pakistanis when he played for Gloucester. In his statistics he is recorded of having bowled no balls, despite it also listing him as a right-handed bowler. His cricket career ran from 1969 to 1984. His actual job is unknown, but given his scores, and the small wages that non-international cricketers receive, it is unlikely that he made a living from his sporting endeavours.
