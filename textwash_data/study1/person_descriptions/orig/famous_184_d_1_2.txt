Ed Sheeran is famous in British music history for being the first person to pack out stadiums for minimalist, largely uninspiring, and boredom inducing shows. Having had to sit through four nights of his show--the songs in which largely morphed into one--his insistence on appearing as though he is only an infrequent visitor to a shower became all the more annoying. He is bland. Boring. Beige, if you would like a colour description. One of the most hateful things about his art is that there is actually so little to hate owing to there not being anything sufficiently controversial for his songs to be noteworthy. While many of these accusations have been levelled at James Blunt, Blunt has wit. Sheeran does not. His one redeeming feature is his watching of Ipswich Town Football Club, situated where I once lived. However, his choice of club also represents his personality. Ipswich Town prior to the most recent relegation were notable for having spent the longest continuous time in the same division of the Football League--no exciting promotions, near misses, cup runs or anything else. Just like the man, even the football he watches is dull.
