Lucia is a short, sparky woman in her early sixties. She is the Chief Marketing Officer for a Pharmaceutical company, where she has worked for almost 10 years. Her interest in biology started at a young age, and she spent much of her childhood outdoors exploring the fields surrounding her home in County Cork, Ireland. She studied Biology at University College Cork, where she picked up a keen interest in the more detailed processes. She then went on to study a Masters degree in Biochemistry at University College Dublin, before taking the plunge to move to the UK for her PhD in Pharmaceuticals at Queen Mary's University, London. After this she started working in a laboratory for a pharmaceutical company, but soon found that her true talents lie in her enthusiasm in her subject coupled with her ability to talk forever, facilitating a move into the marketing sector of the company. Her thorough understanding of the products gave her an acute advantage , enabling her to move swiftly through the ranks of the company, until she reached the glass ceiling. There was no obvious reason that she was being missed for promotions, she was still on the top of her field, but seemingly endlessly her peers were being promoted ahead of hear, and soon the same story with those who had significantly less experience. At this point Lucia left the company to move back to Ireland, having found a rival female-led company who would treat her with respect, but not before suing her old employer for gender discrimination. Since moving back to her home country, she has enjoyed a much more relaxed way of life, and has taken up gardening and the harp, as well as having time to rekindle her love of nature which took her down this path in the first place.
