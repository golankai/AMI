Charles Black was a constitutional jurist, most famous for his authorship of the book, Impeachment: A Handbook, which served as an important tool for constitutional understanding during the Watergate scandal.

Born in Texas in 1915, he worked as a professor of law for most of his adult life.  He died aged 85 in New York City in 2001.

Due to his vehement opposition to the death penalty, Black wrote a book called Capital Punishment: The Inevitability of Caprice and Mistake, outlining his position on the increasingly mediaeval practice.

During his studies at university, Black developed an appreciation for jazz music.  His particular admiration for Louis Armstrong helped foster a burning desire to advance the civil rights movement in the south.

Outside of academia, black employed his jurisprudential acumen in the seminal case of Brown vs Board of Education, for which he wrote the legal briefs.
