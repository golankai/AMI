Rinda gives off mad Miranda Priestley vibes. She expects nothing but the best from her employees and is frequently hard to read, but once her loyalty has been earned, you have her unwavering support. She is known for her colourful fashion and everchanging acrylic nails (always tastefully done). Her hair is platinum blonde and cut into a severe bob. Rinda has two adult children who find her humorous rather than intimidating. They are both hipsters and find her mom's obsession with work and status a bit offputting. Her husband is mild-mannered and lets her call the shots for the most part. She has three Dobermans who are all brothers.
