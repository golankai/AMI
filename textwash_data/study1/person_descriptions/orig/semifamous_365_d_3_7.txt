Charles Black Lund Jr. was an American Scholar of constitutional law. He was born in Austin, Texas - home of bbq - where he attended the University of Texas, which is also home to the Texas Longhorns Football program. Having no interest in football he went to Yale Law School and then served in the Army Air Corps as a teacher (amongst other things).
Not being scared of over-achieving he then became a Professor of Law at Colombia University Law School and got involved in civil rights cases in the South. He ended up being Dean of Colombia Law School in 1986.
He also writes poetry and has published three volumes - easy peasy right?!
His main legacy is Brown vs Board of Education Impeachment: A Handbook.
