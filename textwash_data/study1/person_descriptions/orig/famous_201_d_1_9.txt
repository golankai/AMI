Hugh is a very famous Hollywood actor.  He has been in many movies such as; Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones’s Diary and Notting Hill.  In my opinion is has a rugged sexiness and this helps him portray the characters he plays.  He is slim and personable.  Outside the cinema he has been quite outspoken politically in recent years.  He became quite involved in the 2019 election when he targeted tactical voting to remove power from the Conservatives. Previously he had supported Liberal Democrat’s values in other rallies and elections.
A few years ago Hugh gained a good pay out from a newspaper for making defamatory allegations that were found to be false.
He is, of course, British and still spends much of his time in this Country.
