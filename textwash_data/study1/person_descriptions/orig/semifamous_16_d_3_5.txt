Kenny Kramm, who as a distraught father concocted a flavored additive for his infant daughter’s anti-seizure drug, later marketing the product through pharmacies across the country and helping make the medicine go down for millions of children, died July 12 at a hospital in Washington. He was 55.

He contracted an infection that resulted in sepsis and cardiac arrest, said his wife, Shelley Kramm.

The son of a pharmacist, Mr. Kramm grew up working at his family’s business, Center Pharmacy in the Spring Valley neighborhood of Washington. He had joined the operation as a business manager by 1992, when he and his wife had their second daughter, Hadley.

Severely premature, she suffered a brain hemorrhage when she was 10 days old and developed disabilities including cerebral palsy. “When you have a baby, you have boundlesshopes for them,” Mr. Kramm told Inc. magazine in 2003. “All we could do was ask, ‘What is the best we can hope for? Will she be able to walk? Will she talk?’ ”
