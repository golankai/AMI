Sam Smith is a young male British musician. He has an extremely unpleasant demeanour and recently insisted the media use the pronoun 'their' to describe him as apparently after all these years, he/she isn't sufficient. He is incredibly obnoxious and arrogant and so full of his own self importance. He was also pictured crying on the steps of his mansion during the covid19 pandemic, conveniently placed for paparazzi, totally oblivious and insensitive to the struggles of average people. He is a very unlikeable person and what tiny amount of talent he has is completely overshadowed by his embarrassing attempt to jump on the gender neutral bandwagon. I cannot think of a celebrity I dislike more.
