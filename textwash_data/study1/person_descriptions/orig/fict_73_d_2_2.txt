Very monotone boring old man. Bald with glasses. Wears an old wrinkled suit and carries a scruffy looking black briefcase filled with plans. Travels to work on the train and always complains theres no seats.  Has 3 kids all with professional degrees. Loves the family dog more than he loves his poor wife Mrs O'Conner. Likes hill walking, reading and going to the football. Always likes beer on a friday and saturday night, sometimes even on a sunday if the week before was stressful. Goes on holiday to Belgium and moans about how Germany is nicer with better food. Loves a schnitzel so he does, shows by his gut busting belly popping through his shirt.
