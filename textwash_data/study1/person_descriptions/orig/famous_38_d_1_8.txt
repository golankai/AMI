Christian Bale was the best Batman from all the actors that have played Batman. He is a British actor who I believe makes a lot of dark films. He is very popular with the ladies. He has won many awards including an academy award and two global globes. His date of birth is 30th January 1974. He has stared in films such as The dark knight trilogy, American Psycho, American Hustle, Terminator Salvation and The Fighter and Ford V Ferrari to name a few. An inspirational quote of his is ""i tend to think you're fearless when you recognize why you should be scared of things, but do them anyway."" another is ""What i like about it is that i'm not somebody  who's in movies, i'm a guy who's not very good going around the track with a bunch of guys who are a hell of a lot lot better.""
