Adele is very famous. She has recently been in the news allot due to her drastic weight loss. She has always looked beautiful, however now looks very healthy. Adele has started to exercise and eat more healthy. I think that Adele has been on the voice before however I cannot remember.

Adele has many different awards for her songs. I think we have allot more to come in terms of music from Adele. Adele lives I think in America. I am unsure how many children she has . I think she is very happily married. Due to COVID many artists tours have been cancelled, including Adele's. I have never seen Adele live, however I would love to be able to one day.
