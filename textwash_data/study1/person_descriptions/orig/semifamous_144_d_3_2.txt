William P. Bettendorf was an absolute legend. He was born on July 1 1857 until sadly passing on June 3, 1910. He was a German-American inventor who loved getting crafty and coming up with wacky ideas. He is wellknown for his mind-bending invention of the power lift sulky plough, the Bettendorf metal wheel and the one-piece railroad truck frame - Oustanding work Bill! By the age of 53 he held a staggering 94 patents, an amazing feat for a man of that era. His younger brother Joseph W. Bettendorf, jointly founded the Bettendorf Axle Company with his bro Bill. His first wife and children preceded him in death which was very sad. He died as the company was rapidly expanding and before he moved into a palatial home he was building. The city of Bettendorf, Iowa is named after the two brothers.
