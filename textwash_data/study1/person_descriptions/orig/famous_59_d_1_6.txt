Singer, Used to be large but is now skinny. She has an operatic pop voice. Short. Used to have blonde hair but unsure now. Worldwide famous. She names her albums after her age (19,21,25) she has become less relevant recently though. Somewhat controvetial recently due to having her hair done in a racially incensative way. Im not sure if im a fan of the way she currently looks as it is such a far cry from what i am used to seeing from her. She is now Ballerina (ultra) skinny! Her voice tends to fill a room. Shes done a mixture of pop songs and slow songs. Her voice is quite rangey and dynamic. She tends to show up once every few years.
