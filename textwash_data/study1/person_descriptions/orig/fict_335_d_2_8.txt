Rugged good looks; square jaw, ensonced with grey-beard, cut short. Piercing and deeply black eyes with a firm nose and heavy, thick yet very attractive eyebrows; Herman is a man's man with ease and poise in all situations. His shoulders are broad, his frame firm and proportioned, his forearms strong and tanned and his legs like girders of steel bronzed from cycling around Andalusia in the sun.  His skin is an olive-bronzed flawless glow all year round and his dress sense is a mixture of modern Parisien chic mixed with ethic-new-age dress down vibe seen on the streets of NYC and the Bronx.  His relationship is relatively new - his boyfriend is from Morocco and has recently been accepted onto a PhD course at the Prado in Madrid with a residency in Bogota where Hermann's company are to relocate him to set up their South American offices and expand their buisness model due to the decline of the British marketing buisinesses and their problems post-Brexit and the illigality of the BoJo unilateral withdrawal of the Eu/UK agreements which led to the break up of the UK.
