Kenneth Lee Kramm (June 16, 1961 â€“ July 12, 2016) was an American entrepreneur who founded FLAVORx. FLAVORx is a very innovative flavouring system that allows people to stomach taking medicines that had bad tastes. Mr Kramm initially studied Advertising Design at the University of Maryland but realized it was not the career for him after graduating. Kramm had two children, one of who was quite ill  and had trouble with epileptic seizures. The daughter found the medicine very terrible tasting and the Kramm parents decided something must be done to improve the medicine. Thus FLAVORx was born. Kramm died from sepsis in 2016.
