Adele sings well. I am not really a fan of her music but it goes through plenty of people especially if they share the same experience. She is beautiful. She speaks in this very enchanting accent. She is lovely, funny, intelligent, cheerful. She loves her family. I really love how blonde her hair gets. She was fat before but a tremendous change was seen in her physique recently. I hope that doesn't affect her singing prowess. I hope she makes more good music. I hope she can be seen in public or in social media as often as before. Is she married? If she still doesn't I hope she finds somebody who will love her and make her happy for lifetime.
