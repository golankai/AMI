Ferd Homenick is a 53 year old drug dealer from Belgium who has been under the watchlist of many police states. Having come close to being arrested multiple times, he has always evaded capture, as if he had a partner who saw everything. Funnily enough, Ferd Homenick is a single man with no prior love interests. In fact, a psychologists report put Ferd in the top 5% of peole who are unable to form any sortof emotional connection. The medical term for this is sociopath, and when Ferd was told his diagnosis he reportedly tried to hurt the psychologist who made his diagnosis. He has since the age of 17 led a life of crime, being charged for supplying drugs and attempted murder of the psychologist.
