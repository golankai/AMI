Ed Sheeran is a British singer-songwriter who rose to prominence by releasing a series of hit singles which were fully produced by himself, mostly using the loop pedal feature to multi-track his music, a skill he performed live on occasions. Although his rapping was questionable in the early days, he overcame this and the limitations of his ginger hair and geeky appearance to become one of the world's most successful and wealthy musicians. He once occupied every position of the UK top 10 singles chart when his album was released, leading to the chart system to be redesigned to prevent this happening again. Ed has appeared in Game of Thrones and also the movie Yesterday in which he played a cool version of himself.
