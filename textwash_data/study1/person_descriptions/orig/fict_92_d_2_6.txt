Rinda looks young for her ages, years of beauty treatments paying off. She has her hair coloured a soft blonde, it is flattering and youthful It also makes her feel more confident when talking to clients. Rinda smiles a lot and there are a few smile lines around a generous mouth. A gentle red lipstick is her favourite colour.
Rinda is above average in height, although she still wear heels. She maintains a fashionable appearence. As a sales executive she wants to look put together in front of clients and there are so many young executives in the office who are desperate to succeed. As she has grown older she has started to gain a little weight, but she enjoys food too much to change her habits now. Her husband loves her as she is so she doesn't feel any pressure to change.
