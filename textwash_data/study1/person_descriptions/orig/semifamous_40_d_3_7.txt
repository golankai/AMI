Charles Black made his name as a staunch defender of civil rights and an outspoken critic of use of the death penalty in the US. Originally studying English in Texas, he completed his LLB at Yale, returning as a professor following a stint at Columbia, to which he returned in the later years of his career. Many of his students went on to become leaders in their respective fields, including notably, Hilary Clinton, and Barbara Aronstein Black, Black's wife and the first female dean of an Ivy League law school.

Cutting his teeth serving as a teacher in the Army Air Corps and working as an associate at an international law firm, Black attributes his passion and interest in race and civil rights to a performance by acclaimed jazz artist Louis Armstrong enjoyed as a freshman. He was skilled at making Americans face uncomfortable truths and challenging its racist structure, nevermore so evident than his work on the landmark Brown v Board of Education. Despite massive public resistance, the ruling that racial segregation in schools was inherently unconstitutional started to unpick the racist tapestry that still persists today in the US.

A prolific writer, Black authored more than 20 books, including ""Impeachment: A Handbook"" and ""Capital Punishment: the Inevitability of Caprice and Mistake"". He also practised what he preached to his students in terms of diversification of interests both in law and beyond; becoming an expert in admiralty law, publishing three volumes of poetry, a lover of ballet, music and art - including his own attempts at playing the trumpet and painting numerous oil landscapes.
