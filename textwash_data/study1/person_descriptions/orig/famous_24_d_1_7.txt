He used to play in Harry Potter, he is English , medium height with black hair, does not smile that much, I know little about him. He has played in a few films like the Black Widow, but it is not an actor I follow, He looks quite bland with not much of a personality.I see him as someone who does not talk very much and he seems very quiet but of course this could be for his public image.He does not seem to have a good or bad reputation. he is seen as the good English boy from Harry Potter. He does not reflect the Holywood star actor, even if he played in all the Harry Potter films and is famous I do not see him as the ""Wow"" factor but it's my personal opinion.
