Born on 12 July 1990, Yassine El Ghanassy followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a football player - drawing attention from other clubs while playing at the youth team of La Louvi√®re. Known for assisting fellow teammates in securing a goal, he also proved he was capable of scoring the final goal when it mattered as shown by his goal against the Belarusian team in the Champions League qualifiers in 2010. It was the only goal in that game, which meant that his team (Gent) qualified for the third qualifying round as a result of his actions.
Outside of football, he gained a reckless streak of speeding - continuously refusing to learn from his mistakes up to his 15th speeding offence leading him to a 6 month prison sentence and 2 year ban from driving, as ruled in 2018.
