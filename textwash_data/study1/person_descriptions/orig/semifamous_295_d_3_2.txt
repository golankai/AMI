William P. Bettendorf was an American-German inventor, most famous for inventing the power lift sulky plow, the Bettendorf metal wheel and the one-piece railroad truck frame. William was the oldest of four children and as a young man joined Peru Plow Company, where he later went on to invent the first power lift sulky plow, which revolutionised the farming sector as it finally allowed farmers to stay sat on his horse-drawn cart whilst pressing a lever to lift the plow from the ground. 

It was with his brother that he set up Bettendorf Axle Company and before his untimely death at just 52, he held 94 patents. The city of Bettendorf, Iowa is named after the two brothers.
