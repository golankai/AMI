Rinda Schuster works as a sales executive in England. At 69, she is currently married. Rinda has lived a wholesome life, falling in love with her childhood sweetheart and having 4 kids, with 3 grandchildren and more on the way. Schuster continues to impress her family and those around her by refusing to retire, and insisting that work is what is keeping her young. She has achieved employee of the month status 28 times and continues to excel in sales. Rinda, who is originally Swedish, has settled comfortably in Cornwall with her husband. She has chosen this location as she feels at peace by the ocean, and she finds everything is a walking distance away. When she eventually retires, she hopes to re-model her humble home into a luxury villa for her children to vacation in.
