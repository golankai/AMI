Kenny Kramm was an american entrepreneur, born in Washington but raised in Maryland. His biggest claim to fame was that he came up with the idea of adding flavour to badly tasting, often bitter tasting medicine to make it palatable. He created a business called FLAVOURx after he and his wife had the amazing idea to flavour medicine due to a very sad and stressful time with their daughter. Kenny had married his wife in 1985 and had two children together. He graduated at University of Maryland with a degree in advertising design and ended up getting a job as an art director for a agency. He then went onto work in his fathers pharmacy firm in washington as a business manager. That same year, he had his youngest daughter which unfortunatly had epileptic seizures after her birth. The medication she had to take regularly to stop or control her seizures tasted so bad that they had a very hard time getting her to take it properly. this resulted in more seizures and Kenny and his wife had enough, deciding to try to figure out how to make them taste better. His father suggested making them taste sweeter by flavouring the medication from a sweets manufacturer.
