Famous actor on TV, film and theatre. Most known for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Strange in the Avengers. Handsome chap although not when he grows his hair as it goes curly. He was the voice of the dragon in The Hobbit movies and used real time capture to animate the dragon. He's done lots of theatre too but I'm not sure what. He's tall with strangely small eyes.
