Mrs Glover is a middle aged woman with grey hair which she allows  to grow naturally with no added colour.  She is well groomed and wears her hair in a bob. She wears very little makeup, just lipstick and she has a beautiful skin which is unblemished.
She does not wear much jewellery apart from a wedding ring and a brooch in the tailored suit she wears for work.
She wears sensible shoes with a small cuban heel.
During her leisure time she can be seen jogging in shorts and vest and she monitors her heart rate with a device on her upper left arm. She wears earphones when she runs to listen to lectures.
She enjoys cooking and crochet and so keeps her fingernails short and neatly filed. However, she paints her toenails.
Her right hip bothers her and she limps when she gets tired.
