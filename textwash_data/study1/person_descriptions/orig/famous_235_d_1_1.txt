He is a British actor, famous for playing Sherlock and appearing in a host of other popular things such as Frankenstein and Star Trek. This means he has performed on stage and in television and film.  He has a CBE for his brilliant career. I believe he comes across as a very intelligent individual, and he is often portrayed in this way in the roles he is given in films. This may also be because he was a Shakespearean actor in prep school. Apparently he is insecure about his name. This may stem from many jokes being made about the complexity of the sound of his name. These jokes became widespread over social media.
