Born on 15 April 1990, Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson is an actress - who first rose to fame through her portrayal of Hermione Granger in the hugely successful Harry Potter film series. Since then, she has gone on to star as Belle (the beauty) in the Disney live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, as well as many other roles in Noah, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Circle and more. 
The 30-year-old has also done her fair share of modelling and speaking up for equality as a feminist and activist. For instance, she has promoted education for girls in developing countries and as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador (since 2014), she delivered a powerful address to launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe that inspired others like Malala Yousafzai to call herself a feminist.
