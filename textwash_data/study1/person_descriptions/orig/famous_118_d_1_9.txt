He's an actor, he plays in films. I don't really know much about him honestly. If he was that famous, I could have known more about him but, seems not. His quite old, you can see the white hairs coming out already, maybe he is worried he isn't as famous...

He somewhat looks like Boris Johnson, although they do totally different jobs. His girlfriend also looks like a male, I do not know that's up with that. he is British, I think he could be one of the judges at Britain’s got talent. He became really well-known after appearing in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). I think that movie wasn’t so great, must have been why he isn’t so famous.
