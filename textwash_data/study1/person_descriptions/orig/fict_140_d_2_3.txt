Hasan is a bright young man working as a consulting civil engineer at a startup in Canada. He works with his friends from university. The start up takes up most of his time and is generally very stressful but he loves coming back home from work to meet his partner who he hopes to marry soon. He is generally a stressed man and is used to being the breightest and quietest person in the room. He does appreciate adventures and is hence in love with his partner who is a travel journalist. Hasan moved to Canada with his friends for work and knows the importance of hard work in order to thrive in society and is very keen on making it big in the engineering industry. He quit his job at a major firm back in his home country because he was tired of being an average consultant focusing on boring tasks.
