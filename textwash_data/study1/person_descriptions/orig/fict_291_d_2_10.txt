Amelie Crooks had a French Mother (hence the French surname) and a Brittish Father (Crooks) They lived together in a small but cosy cottage in the countryside in the UK.Amelie's father ran a small company and he was often working with the I.T. department ,he had an interest in Linux as a hobby and wanted his daughter to learn from a young age as he believed that computers were the technology of the future. He encouraged Amelie to explore the tech available at the time as they would spend weekend afternoons working on projects such as building robots,learning how to use an CD ROM encyclopedia and how to type on a keyboard. He was very patient and encouraging which helped Amelia build self esteem and a growth mindset.She kept these teachings that helped her throughout school,university & when looking for a job.That there would be mistakes made,but they were learning experiences.Amelie preferred to be single,surrounded by her friends as her support system,she was independent.She moved to Austria after the company she worked for moved there,she struggled at first adjusting but she enjoyed a challenge,was a strong & brave woman.Although she missed her home town,she liked the adventure of moving to another country & experiencing a different culture,she had a pretty open mind,but she did have strong values regarding personal privacy especially when it came to tech & volunteered to help others online in matters of tech competency and privacy laws...
