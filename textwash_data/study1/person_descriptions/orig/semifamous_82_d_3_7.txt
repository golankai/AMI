Charles Black is a professor of law. He wrote a book about the Watergate scandel in the US. He has also written poetry. He was born in Austin Texas and graduated form Austin University in 1935 with a masters in English. He served in the army. He was against the death penalty. He wrote a bunch of stuff. He died in 2001. He was born in 1915 so he was really old. His name was Charles Black Junoir so I assume there is a Charles Black senior. There is no news about where he lived, whether he married or had any children. I like to think he did. That would be nice. Otherwise his life seems quite dull and boring.
