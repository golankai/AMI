This guy always looks to me like a guy who really didn't care what people think of him. He never seems to dress up its a bit like 'take me for what I am ' attitude which I kinda like and get. He has just had his first child and I think this child will grow up in a relaxed home with lots of love. I also think he will most certainly be a hands on dad, when he is at home. He certainly has a funny side to him as I can remember the cameo role he had in Bridget Jones the third film. In this he meets her friend at a concert and they get to roll down a hill in one of those large plastic balls that people can run, I could imagine  that they had a lot of fun filming that !!!! His music has always been well received in the music industry and he has won quite a few awards from Brit Awards to best sole artist and British breakthrough act. He also proved his worth by having two solo hits in the USA both together at the same time. In total he has sold  150 million records worldwide which makes him on of the world's famous selling music artists, not only that but he has 84.5 million RIAA certified unit in the US. Not only those prestige titles but two of his albums are in the list of the best selling albums in the UK chart history reaching 20 and 34. To be honest this guy has worked hard and achieved great heights you could write pages and pages of stuff but in December 2019 he was officially named artist of the decade by Official Charts Company with the most .combined success in the UK album and singles charts in the 2010's. Then to top it all his tour in March 2017 became the highest grossing of all time in August 2019.
