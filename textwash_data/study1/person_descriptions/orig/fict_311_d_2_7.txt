Born in 1967, Liana Glover pursued the conventional path of obtaining an degree and doctorate in the field of Accounting and Finance. With a knack for studying, she gained a chartered ACA qualification alongside working at EY to become an accountant.
A profession that she continues to work in at age 53 (with 6 years until she reaches retirement age) in Slovenia. 
Outside of work, she's happily married to Ian Glover with a single child, Clara - who's 23 years old. Due to the equal retirement age in Slovenia, she plans to travel around Europe with her husband - with an explicit desire to visit to see the landmarks in particular.
