Dr Ratke is an enthusiastic about his job as museum education officer. Reciting and delivering historical figures and events lights up his nerdy antenna's giving him an outlet to teach young people, in a creative way about Ugandan history. 
He has not yet found someone whom he can share his hobbies with and didn't seem to be much of a priority until recently. Having just turned 37 years old, Dr Ratke has dark skin, is small head, is tall and slender. He wears a blue suit and a vest on top when he is on duty. He is charismatic in his work but outside of his workplace headquarters does not have much experience socialising.
