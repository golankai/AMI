Mick Jagger is an English Musician, he is a White 72/73 year old male who has a Funky hair cut with a fringe and whom I believe wears Leather pants and boots. 
His genre of music is Rock n roll. 
Maroon 5 have a song with Christina Agularia called moves like Jagger so Iâ€™m assuming he could dance pretty well in his time as well. 

He was born in London dartford and part of the group Rolling Stones. 
The Rolling Stones were a big hit group in the 70s & 80s the time of the beetles I believe?  


He has a lot of children and I think got married twice/ 3 times. 

I think people loved Mick Jagger
