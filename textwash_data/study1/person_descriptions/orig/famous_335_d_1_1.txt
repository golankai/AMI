A rather well-spoken, quite tall, deceptively thin quintessentially 'English' actor whom has found fame on the stage, repertoire, small screen, large screen and Hollywood fame, most notably as an on-screen all-round bad guy in one of the many, often utterly confusing and impenetrably overly-complicated Star Trek franchise films.  His accent is evolved as are his mannerisms on and off screen. He is not known for his political views but has commented occasionally upon issues as diverse as equal pay and under-represented groups in Hollywood and beyond. He was feted as Sherlock Holmes, one of the BBC's most successful exports, bringing in much needed foreign-exchange at a time when this country is led by donkeys with I.Q. of the vaccum of space and the morality and mores of some of histories' most evil tyrants.  His skin is as white as the driven snow, his voice as silky as a sow's ear, his eyes as penetrating as a psychologist on Mollies and his hair as unruly as BoJo's after an all night sex and drugs party. His dress sense is eclectic; bohemian sheik one day, Hoxton cyclist the next - but tweeds and corduroy's are never far from his vestibule cupboard.
