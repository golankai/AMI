A once child actor who is probably best known for starring in the film series Harry Potter. Since its completion he has gone on since then to star in further Hollywood films and is probably considered an A list celebrity. He is British and has a very distinct acting style and recognizable inflections in his voice. Description wise, he's below average height with dark hair and lighter eyes. In interviews he usually seems very passionate about his work and beliefs, and is rumored to be fun loving and friendly towards his fans. If he's continued his career in Hollywood it's been flying a bit under the radar, as his name has been out of headlines for quite some time now.
