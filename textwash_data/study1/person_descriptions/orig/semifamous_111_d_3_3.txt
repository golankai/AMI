Yassine El Ghanassy is (currently) 30 year old Belgian football player for Al-Raed on loan from Nantes. As he is of Moroccan origin, Yassine has a double nationality. He was called by the national coach Georges Leekens (at that time) to play in for his first international game for Belgium and since the game was a friendly (against Finland), Yassine is still eligible to play for Morocco. Throughout his career, Yassine has been on loan in numerous occasion which led him to play in Belgium, Norway, Netherlands, UAE, England and France. Between 2009 and 2010 (when he was 19-20 years old), Yassine has gathered attention by many European top teams, most notably AC Milan and Manchester City. However, he did not live up to the expectations for much longer, hence a transfer move to these clubs never materialized.
