Young and handsome British actor with quite an aristorcratic air about him, floppy hair, equine nose. He is best known for playing SHerlock Holmes recently. He is slender, quite posh and has done a lot of acting. That;s all I can think of, really, I don;t know much more about him. He is maybe in his mid-thirties? He has done some shakespeare. He has a name that has resulted in many memes and a  name generator on the internet.  Some people would say he has a very posh and ridiculous name ndohpdindspndspighdspgndpsnvsdogndspghsdpbnsdpgnsfoignsiongsoinsdvsdpnvsoibnfobnsognsdognsodbnsobnsofnbsfobnsf
