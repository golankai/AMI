Daniel Radcliffe is an English actor best known for his role as Harry Potter in the eponymous series about a hidden world of wizarding. Radcliffe played the role from around 11 until 22. Following this, Radcliffe continued acting, favouring less conventional roles in Equus, Extras, Imperium and Swiss Army Man. 

Outside of his acting roles, Daniel Radcliffe virtue signals extensively, promoting extremely liberal causes.

He condemned JK Rowling but did not respond to any of her specific concerns.
