Dr. Dwaine O'Conner is a German hydrographic surveyor. He is 62 years old, and was born in Munich on the 30th April, 1958. He graduated from the Free University of Berlin with a bachelor's degree in geology in 1980. Following this, he completed a PhD in 1985 at the same university, studying techniques for working with geospatial data in marine environments. He had originally intended to pursue a professorship, but ultimately decided to enter the industry as a hydrographic surveyor instead, as he was offered a very good position. Spending a lot of the year at sea, he occupies himself by reading a lot of books and writing short stories. He and his partner keep in contact via Skype, and they have always handled the long periods of distance as best as they can, though they are both now looking forward to the day that he retires.
