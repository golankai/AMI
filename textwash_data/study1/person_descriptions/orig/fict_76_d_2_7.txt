Dr Liana Glover is a Slovenian-British Chartered Accountant. Born in Ljubjana in 1967, Glover moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 11 with her family, settling in Livingston, Scotland and attending the local comprehensive secondary school.

Glover was considered an academically gifted child, and earned a scholarship to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Upon completion of her undergraduate studies, Glover trained for, and eventually qualified as, a Cardiologist. Glover met her future spouse whilst training as a Junior Doctor at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, but quickly found that she did not enjoy the long hours and stress involved.

With the support of her partner, Glover left frontline medicine to work as the bookkeeper for a local GP's Surgery, studying for the ACA in the evening and eventually qualifying as a Chartered Accountant.

Glover and her wife were married in 2017 and live in South Edinburgh.
