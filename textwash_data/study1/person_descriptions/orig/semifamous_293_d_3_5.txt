Kenny Kramm is an American enterpreneur known for making medication taste better.
Because the last thing you need when you are ill, is having to ingest something disgusting.
Jokes aside, the reason that brought him to this 'discovery' was his daughter's epilepsy. She was refused to swallow the medicine.
As medication was necessary to his wellbeing, Kenny's father suggested to find a way to flavour it.
So really it was Kenny's father who 'discovered' the trick and I am not sure why he is not the guy with his own Wikipedia page? 
I guess, the main point is that we don't have to ingest disgusting medicines.
