William P. Bettendorf was born in 1857 in Mendota, Illinois, USA. He founded the Bettendorf Axle Company with his younger brother, which was destroyed by fires in 1902. In 1878, he invented the first power lift sulky plow, a device which allowed a farmer to raise the plow using a lever, remaining seated on the horse. He also invented the Bettendorf metal wheel and the one-piece railroad truck frame. The advantage of the one-piece railroad truck frame was that it contained no bolts (bolts could loosen during travel and cause delays). He had two wives and two children. He died in Davenport, Iowa in 1910.
