Christian Bale is a proffesional actor from the UK. He has dark hair which is long for a male and a pale skin tone. He is probably best known for his role in the Batman movie inwich he plays Batman.

He also played the main character Patrick Bateman in the movie American Psycho.  He has received many awards for his works including an Academy award and a Critics choice movie award for best actor.

He has been quoted to say 'I love burgers' from this we can draw the conclusion that he likes to eat burgers.

Bale is now nearly 47 years of age and has retired from his role as Batman.

This means Christian was born in 1974 in Wales. To be completely honest I know not much else about him and I do not have the time to research because we were only given 40 minutes to complete the task and I still need to write two more profiles.

I assume Christian acted in lots of other movies and maybe some TV shows but I would not know becaue I have not seen them.  If I had more time I would be able to deliver more factual information. 

He was educated in Bournemouth which is surprising because honestly I cant imagine many actors or people in creative arts are educated in Bournemouth. Or maybe im wrong and Bournemouth is actually the global hub of acting. Or not.

Apparently his zodiac sign is Aquarius. Which is a fact I doubt even he knows because zodiac signs are stupid and I doubt an actor as famous and busy as Christian Bale has time to worry about things like that.

He probably has a lot of money because he has played prominent roles in so many movies. He has spent his money on things like food, cars and houses. Amongst other things I assume.

Apparently Bale scored his first role in a commercial at the age of 9 which is impressive because at that age I hadn't even gotten my pen license.
