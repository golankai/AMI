Malcolm Dunstan is an ex English Cricketer. Supposedley he was born in Cornwall but that is a topic of controversy. Because some would say Redruth is not a part of Cornwall. But that is a discussion for another day.

The surname Dunstan is of Anglo-Saxon origin and was given to a family when they lived near a stony hill. Which is perhaps the weirdest reason to give someone a name. It is unknown whether Malcolm himself lives near a stony hill.

He was right handed alongside an estimated 90-93 percent of the population. In this case being in the majority isnt considered an advantage because lots of left sided athletes have an edge over their right sided counterparts.

He represented the county of Cornwall over 100 times which is more than 10x10. Thats quite a lot by my calculations. 

Malcolm also captained Cornwall at points which is pretty impressive.
What Malcolm is doing nowadays is unknown but now aged at 69 I doubt its Cricket.
