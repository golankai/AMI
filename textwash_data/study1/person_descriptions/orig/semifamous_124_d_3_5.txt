Kenny Kramm was an American pharmacist who developed a system of adding flavour to unpleasant-tasting medicines to make them easier to swallow.

The idea, which developed into a business called Flavorx, was born out of desperation. Krammâ€™s second daughter Hadley had been born with cerebral palsy and, as an infant, refused to take the foul-tasting anti-seizure medicines she had been prescribed, vomiting or spitting them out. Three times a day her parents had to pin her down, force open her mouth and try to get her to swallow her medicine. Missing a dose even once could bring on violent convulsions and cause further brain damage.
