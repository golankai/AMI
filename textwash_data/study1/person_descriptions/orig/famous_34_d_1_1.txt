Benedict Cumberbatch is an English, male, white actor, who seems to take lead roles in many significant films and projects like The Imitation Game, Patrick Melrose. Peculiarly and intelligently handsome, I think â€“ with sharp green eyes, a deep voice and dominant cheekbones. Likes playing intelligent roles - made the character of Sherlock Holmes his own - moody, self-conscious. He's tall and very affable when interviewed. Much less self-conscious than his roles. Seems a good role model . . . married, too, to Sophie Hunter, who appears arty, witty and intelligent, like Cumberbatch. He can be great fun - for example on Graham Norton's show. He has been awarded the CBE for both his acting and for charity work, which shows a warm and concerned heart. I like him.
