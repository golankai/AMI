he is a business man in sales so I can imagine is very encouraging, enthusiastic with that type of work, but he also sounds successful being an executive and he is in his early forties  so has possibly came quite far within his life in regards to his career and could have possibly taken his name of his dad as it says Jr for junior. He is in a relationship so it could possibly still be new or I could be mistaken but I think it is new as he isn't married and he lives in Spain but not sure if he was born there or moved there but I think he was born there as his name sounds a bit different for me.
