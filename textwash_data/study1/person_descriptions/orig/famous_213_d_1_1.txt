Best known as Dr Steven Strange from the Marvel Comic Book 'Avengers' stable, Benedict Cumberbatch is a British Actor in his 40's .  He has played Sherlock Holmes on tv and  appeared in Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysterys, among many other renowend theatre plays.  He is quite strange looking, with a face full of angles and shadows. Tall and lean he is the quintessential British actor playing,  quintessentially British characters. He is very highly paid and very successful, currently a very popular choice for Hollywood movie producers.  He has been linked romantically with Taylor Swift. But no longer.  
Surprisingly he is a graduate of a Manchester University, not an Oxford or Cambridge, and he is actually called Cumberbatch, it is not a made up name!
