Liana is 53 years old and lives in Slovenia. She is currently in a relationship with a man a few years older than she is who is a partner at the company she currently works for. 
She is an accountant and very much enjoys her job but does occasionally find it really dull. She was always good with numbers from a young age and most of her hobbies included number puzzles and so she decided to do this for a living. 
She loves to go skiing and for long walks in her home country but likes to travel to Europe often to go to Switzerland for skiing trips as this is her chosen destination. 
She likes being outdoors but has bad allergies in the summer so her favourite time to walk her dogs for a long walk is in winter when there is snow on the ground. This way she doesnâ€™t get allergies and she loves seeing the snow and hearing the crunch of it under her feet. This is another reason as to why she likes skiing.
