Yassine is a 30 year old professional footballer. He did not plan to retire from football at 30 and never had plans in place for this day however due to a lack of interest in teams he has now been forced to retire at 30. He is on the hunt for a career path that he loves just as much or more than football, he is worried that he may / may not find this. He has spent countless of hours speaking to friends and family to gain some confidence. He is also worried that his previous prison sentence might hold him back as this was not as much of an issue in football. He is happy he has had the opportunity to make a living out of football and is grateful. He is hoping to use some of his savings to set up a business to help young footballers gain certification for various courses which they can use once they retire.
