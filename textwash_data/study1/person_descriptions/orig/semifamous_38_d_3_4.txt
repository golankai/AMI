Clyde then went onto play professional football for the Mumbai football team on 11th January 2016. His first game was against Shillong Jalong, he was so excited. He got to play 59mins of the match before he was tackled down and injured his leg. The game ended on a score of 0-0. Clyde always wondered if they would have won if he was not injured.
