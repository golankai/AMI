Hugh Grant is an actor who came to prominence as a leading man-style actor in romantic films and comedies such as Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, etc. Initially he seemed to take his personal attractions seriously but over his career he has adopted a more self-deprecating approach and can nowadays been seen to have some genuine acting abilities that were perhaps overshadowed early on by the nature of his early roles. He's of medium height, brown hair (now greying), clean-shaven, pleasant smile. Having just googled him I'm surprised to find that he's aged 60 (I would have said late 40s!) and has had five kids, none of which were with his long term partner from the 80s, Liz Hurley, she of the famous safety-pinned dress.
