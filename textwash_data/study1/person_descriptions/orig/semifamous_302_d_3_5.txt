Kenny Kramm was born in Washington DC in 1961. 
He is best known for founding Flavorx,  the company marketed the idea of flavoring medicines to make them more palatable to take. 
His inspiration for this idea came from the frustration that he felt watching his infant daughter struggling to take her medication. She had been prescribed high and multiple doses of Pheynobarbital to try to combat the gran mal seizures she suffered from frequently due to her epilepsy but often would spit out the medicine resulting in her not getting the dose she required. 
Kenny and his father Harold, who had his own pharmacy firm, devised a way of flavoring the medicine, firstly with sugar and then moving on to flavorings used by candy companies. They at last found success and his daughter would accept the medicine that she needed.  A nearby children's hospital were also interested in Kenny's formulas for flavoring medicines and with this idea fresh in his mind he founded Flavorx.
Kenny understood that a spoonful of sugar really does make the medicine go down and thanks to him children around the world are taking the medication they need without the added downfall of a bad taste.
Kenny died in 2016 from sepsis, aged 55.
