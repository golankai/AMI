Born Reg Dwight, Elton John is a pop superstar, with his huge success dating from the early 1970s.  He has had countless best selling singles and albums to his name, and in recent years was 
knighted for his contribution to the Arts.  He has been a lifelong supporter of Watford football club, owning it at one point.
He has always been a flamboyant figure in his outrageous costumes and trademark zany glasses.  He is happily married to his partner, David Furnish.
One of the many highlights of his career was his show-stopping performance at the Live Aid gig in 1985 - he and Paul McCartney famously hoisted Live Aid's organiser Bob Geldof, onto their shoulders at the show's finale.
