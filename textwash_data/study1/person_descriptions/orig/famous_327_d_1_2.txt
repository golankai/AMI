Ed Sheeran is a very famous and highly successful musician.  He is well known for his red hair.  He has a reputation for being very unassuming although he is also very generous and frequently contributes to good causes financially as well as by lending his name and capacity for spreading the word through social media outlets. He has recently had a child with his wife and she has the unusual set of names ""Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran"". He recently released a song about his home town - this was very moving and reflects the fact that he sees himself as an ordinary man and not as the global superstar he is.
