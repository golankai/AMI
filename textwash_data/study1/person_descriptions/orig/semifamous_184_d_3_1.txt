Lincoln may have died aged 40 in 1829 but in four decades he achieved enough to be worthy of a portrait. He died while executing his duty as Governor of Maine, the role for which is most remembered. His burial opposite the Maine State House offers an indication of the high-regard he was held in when he died. The Harvard University graduate had previously been a US Representative for Massachusetts. During his time as governor of Main, disputes along the the north-eastern border persisted. Lincoln implemented educational reforms and chose Augusta as the state capital. That he was a distant relative of Abraham Lincoln, this does not appear to have been a major factor in his life.
