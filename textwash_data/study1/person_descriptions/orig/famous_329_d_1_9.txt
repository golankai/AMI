Hugh Grant is a British actor who typically plays awkward, posh, unmistakably English characters.  While he has his charms, a varied set of acting skills is not chief among them and his movie roles in particular seem to be various versions of, if not himself, then the same character he played in Four Weddings and a Funeral.  His recent TV series, a very English Scandal, highlight his ability to perform well in other roles.

When he first become well known, his career has been somewhat overshadowed by his personal life e.g. his relationship with the glamourous Elizabeth Hurley and his liaison with the prostitute Divine Brown but seemed to be cast in the role of archetypal footloose and fancy-free bachelor. Unlike his characters, this seemed to be a perpetual state of affairs.

To the public, his introduction to fatherhood seemed to typify this.  Later in life than average and within an unfathomable timeline, his involvement with two women has resulted in the birth of four children.  However, does seem to have finally settled down and embraced his role as a father and partner.

His recent appearances in the media appear to relate less to his career and personal life and more to the fight against invasion of privacy by the media, notably over the phone hacking scandal involving the News of the world.
