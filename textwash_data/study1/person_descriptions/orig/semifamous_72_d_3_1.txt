Enoch Lincoln was an American man born in the late 18th century.  He was well educated, graduating from Harvard in the early 19th century.  He studied law although eventually ended up in politics.  He was governor of Maine when he died aged just under forty.  The town of Lincoln in Maine was actually named after him.  He had unusual fair curly hair that stood tall on his head, defying the laws of gravity.  He had one brother who outlived him, and who also went into politics and became governor.  He was the son of Levi Lincoln Senior who was a revolutionary, lawyer and statesman... the family all took a similar professional route in life.
