I've never heard of Sam Smith but apparently he is a famous singer songwriter. My 18 year old daughter says he is hot. In my day we would have said tall dark and handsome! He has a beard - which I don't like and and earing in his ear. Not heard any of his songs but as he is famous they must be good. He is English, white and aged about 28. Apparently worth a lot of money too. He is followed by a lot of people on twitter so seems popular. Apparently he has had a few songs in the charts. from his picture he has short dark hair. He looks pretty friendly. maybe i will listen to one of his songs sometime!
