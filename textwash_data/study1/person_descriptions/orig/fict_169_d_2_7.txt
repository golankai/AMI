She is a trained chartered accountant from Slovenia. As a young student of law, she attended the University of Ljubliana, where she met her partner Sasha, a software engineer. At her age of 53, their relationship is still strong, but the couple have not married, as same-sex marriage is still not legal in their country. She is a fair-haired, short woman who keeps herself in good shape by running and playing squash. In her spare time, she likes hiking and travelling. Her favourite place to visit is the coast of Croatia and has invested in property on the seafront of Zadar. She hopes to one day retire to the property and live her last years with her partner.
