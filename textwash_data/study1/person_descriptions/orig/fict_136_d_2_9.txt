Ferd is a antques dealer who wears old vintage clothes and a heavy brown suede jacket and flat, top cap. He is from Belgium and loves the finer things in life. He was inspired from his grandparents and their predecessors and so is well informed about what makes food, wine and items good quality and well made. He travels Europe trading and dealing his curated collection of mid-century antiques. He is single with no real tie to Belgium, apart from the fact that he has to return every now and then to visit his mother and get his moustache trimmed at his local home-town barber. Otherwise, he lives a nomad life, as this is of course the best way to locate the best antiques - they will not simple come knocking at your door!
