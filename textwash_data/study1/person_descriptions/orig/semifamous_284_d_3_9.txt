Even as a teenager Walter K Chorn was stoic and cool. 
Never known as the most handsome chap in the friend group, he remained reliable.
If his friends were asked to describe them they would say resilient, quiet, hardworking. A good head on his shoulders he had his life plan worked out and he planned to life a long and happy life. 
He loved football, played guard. His build and frame helped him when blocking and tackling. He was broad and stocky, although not quick footed he was quick minded and could read peoples plays as they approached him. This helped him later in life when he became a lawyer.
