Well-known for his role as Harry Potter in the Harry Potter series, Daniel Radcliffe is an English actor, and lesser known, producer. Born on 23rd July, 1989, Radcliffe attended three independent schools for boys with education becoming more difficult when cast in the Harry Potter series. As a result, Radcliffe was educated by on-set tutors. 

Contrary to popular belief, Radcliffe’s acting debut was in a 1999 production of David Copperfield but from 2001, he spent the next 10 years becoming ‘The Boy Who Lived’ and in the meantime, one of the highest-paid actors of the time. Alongside this cane worldwide fame, popularity and critical acclaim. Moving away from his Harry Potter persona, Daniel Radcliffe started in The Woman In Black (2012) as lawyer, Arthur Kipps. Following this, Radcliffe started in many other feature films. 

I’m addition, Radcliffe made his stage debut in 2007 at which Alan Rickman and JK Rowling are reported to have been members of the audience. This proves interesting as it appears, from an interview between Radcliffe and Rowling, that Radcliffe was invited to a casting, for the part of Harry, whilst in the audience of a theatre! 

Although Radcliffe claims he is proud to be a part of the Harry Potter franchise forever, he acknowledges the fact that many fans struggle to see past the character he played in Harry, making it hard for Radcliffe to secure other roles. Despite devoting so much time to the character, Radcliffe answered, when approached about an eighth book, that it would be very unlikely: 10 years is a long time to live through a character.
