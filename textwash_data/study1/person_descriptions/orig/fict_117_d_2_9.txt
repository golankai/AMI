Ferd Homenick is 6ft 1 inches tall. He has an average body build with a beer belly. His medium length brown curly hair is starting to grey and bald at the apex of his head. This portion of his head is usually covered in a hat, mainly a beanie. His eyes wide, dark brown making it hard to see where his pupils begin, above them sit his untamable angry eyebrows that wisp off in every direction. His pale face is covered in deep set wrinkles that reveal the stress of the job. His exterior appearance makes him seem tough although he is a gentle old sole who likes to listen to jazz music in his free time. He has a tenancy to wear all black except for his socks which are fluorescent against his outfit.
