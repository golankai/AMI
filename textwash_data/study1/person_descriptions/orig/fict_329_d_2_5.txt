Lucia Hamill has had a long and respected career in Marketing and, as she approaches an age where many would consider retirement, she has spent several years as the Chief Marketing Officer of her company, which specialises in the production of somewhat gory and violent video games and is the most successful in its category at present.
While she has spent over three decades living in Ireland, she was born in Chile.  After several years working in mining and tourism in the Atacama dessert, she trained as a chef and her recipes for Pastel de Choclo and Cazuela are unsurpassed.  Later, she pursued her studies in Spain, Australia and finally, in Switzerland, where she latterly met the love of her life, the esteemed volcanologist Caoimhe Hamill with whom she set up home in Galway.
