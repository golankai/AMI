Kenny Lee Kramm was the entrepreneur responsible for founding FLAVORx, a medicinal flavoring company, in 1995. Kramm was inspired by a love of Mary Poppins and made it his life's mission to, as he put it in a famous 2015 interview preceding his death, ""help the medicine go down"". He was born in 1961 in Washington D.C., to Susan and Steven Kramm, who were the stars of the widely successful American sitcom, ""SKramm-bled"". The success of the show led the two to become involved in a puritanical protestant anarcho-primitivist cult, who specifically shunned western medicine. In 1965 an outbreak of chickenpox claimed the lives of all 32 members of the cult, except for Kenny. He was raised by his aunt and uncle in Nashville Tennessee, where he was subjected to heavy over-medication by his paranoid caregivers. This led Kenny to attempt a career in medicine, however he quickly abandoned this when the cognitive damage (from years of being given Opioids for minor pain) became apparent. Instead, he became a serial entrepreneur, finally finding success with FLAVORx.
