Dr, Brantley Ratke is a 37-year old man who has just clinched his dream job of becoming an Museum education officer. It's a job that he worked hard on achieving since enrolling in a prison rehabilitation programme for re-offenders. A man, who's drug-fuelled past, led him on a difficult path has achieved yet another thing to be proud of and hopes to write an auto-biography of his past as well as educate the youths in Uganda, his residence, about the pitfalls that the youths of today's society may become embroiled within. He acknowledges his past as sad and due to a complicated family life that has left him single.
