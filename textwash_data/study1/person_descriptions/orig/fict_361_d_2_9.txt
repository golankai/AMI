Ferd Homenick was born and bred in the Belgium city of Antwerp where he still resides and has spent his whole 53 years. He is well known in town and is described as soft spoken and quiet. Despite yearning to travel from a young age he never had the means to do this and just stayed working as a dealer in his home town with great success and has developed good friendships. He has no wife or children but he is not often seen without his loyal dog by his side in town. Ferd recently s diagnosed with emphysema and this is impacting his ability to work but he keeps a positive attitude and is hopeful about treatment.
