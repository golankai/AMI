Mrs. Liana Glover. 

An accountant (chartered) from Slovenia. She is fifty three years old, and is in a relationship with a man names.....well, let's call him Tom. 

Tom is a Youtuber. Liana used to love this fact.

She thought he was a bit like an internet rockstar or celebrity...until she realised Tom usually gets no more than 100 views per month. 

That's when she decided to tell give Tom an ultimatum,

Either get a real job, or increase his viewership at the very least ten fold within a month. 

Tom managed to get about a 10 percent increase in views, mainly because he started his videos with clown makeup on.

Liana and Tom are no longer together.

Mainly due to the fact that she is married.
