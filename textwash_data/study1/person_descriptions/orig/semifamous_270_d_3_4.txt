Clyde Fernandes is a football player that plays in the second division in the country of India. He did play a few times for Mumbai but recently has made his career at Ozone. Due to his age of 26 and lower quality of play, it is unlikely that he will become a football sensation but it is further than most people have gotten. Fernandes once played for the India Under 16s team, but did not progress further in their national youth setup. He is a typical size for a footballing centre back, which will help his efficiency in defence for years to come. It is likely that his profile will become more prevalent in the coming years due to his inclusion in a recent Prolific study, introducing the twenty six year old to a handful extra people that may one day just remember him.
