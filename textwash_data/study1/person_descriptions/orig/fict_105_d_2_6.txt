Rinda Schuster is a sixty-nine-year-old woman who resides in the United Kingdom, England to be more precise. She currently works as a sales executive, probably in a shop. I would assume she is quite high up in her job given her age and the word ""executive"". Rinda is also married, whether this is a happy marriage or not is to be determined but I would guess they have been married for a while. I would also assume Rinda is close to thinking about retiring as she is approaching the age of 80.  I would imagine Rinda as a well-presented lady who takes pride in looking nice as she works in sales, however, this is a wild guess. I would also guess that she has kids, maybe two.
