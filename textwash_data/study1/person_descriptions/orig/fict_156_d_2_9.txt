This man is a top name in the car dealership industry. Starting from a young working age he has single handedly sold more cars than the whole of his dealerships branch, quickly rocketing him up the ranks. At the incredible age of 32 he was promoted to CEO of his company, sealing himself at the top of his career for the rest of his day's. He's been described by his co workers as a rather detached person, yet still friendly and welcome to conversation. This cool exterior has been reported to be off putting at first, but those who have come to know him well have just attributed this trait to shyness, an odd characteristic for such an outgoing profession.
