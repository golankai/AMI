Irvin struggled in his early baseball career to be taken seriously. Coming from the Caribbean he wanted to represent the people that he felt most at ease with - but early 1900's America was not a kind place for people from that part of the world. 
Irvin worked hard to establish himself as a player and not a novelty. He first met Fred Trump in 1928 and was horrified to see that the Ku Klux Klan had such membership. Fred Trump hated all black people and made sure that his overweight child, Donald, also felt the same. Irvin was in a public bathroom in New Jersey when Donald J Trump, aged 7 was struggling to lift himself off the toilet bowl - his over-hanging stomach had wedged him into position. Irvin, pried the fat toddler out of the toilet water and rinsed some of the faeces from Trump's lower legs. Trump cried continously as the kind black man helped him, and Irvin was hopeful that this small encounter might have shaped the way that Donald viewed people of colour. Sadly, it didn't and Irvin would have been horrified to see the state of the Country he called home for so many happy years under the presidency of such an incompetent, narcissitic, man-baby with tiny hands and a misshappen genital area.
