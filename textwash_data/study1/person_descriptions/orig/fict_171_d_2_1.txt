I believe that this person is a white male residing from Stockholm. He is autistic and has never been in a relationship. Although he thinks about this from time to time it doesn't bother him as perhaps it should. He studied hard in school and went onto university to read for a fine art degree. After a doctoral qualification, which conferred the title doctor, he went into academia. The relentless need to publish left him feeling jaded and so he decided to look for a role within industry. Because he was not in a relationship, and his friend group was small, he was able to move for work and was successful in gaining his current role. His relationship with his parents was strained as he came to the realisation that the ABA therapy they inflicted on him as a child was damaging, and led to him considering counselling.
