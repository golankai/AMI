Okay so this individual looks like he was once a famous baseball player in one of the first African American baseball leagues. They called them the negro leagues. He was born and raised in key west, florida. Florida is known for its crime rate and absurdist of the crimes committed but individuals that live there. He has passed away now but he was part of a revolution of famous black people in America. He was an outstanding hitter and many many people came to watch him from around the country. I imagine originally didn't thibk  he would amount to anything - probably due to his race unfortunately as racism was at its height back then.
