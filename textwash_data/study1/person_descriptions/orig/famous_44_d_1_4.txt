Fun and loving character. I believe his music is inspired by his quirky lifestyle and is reach ofor deep emotions. I love his determination to succeed life barriers specifically within his industry. I love his love for his family - especially his mother and later in life for his partner and son. A truly inspiring person full of life and ambitions which have driven my own motivation to do big and better things in the past. I was very taken aback by his determination to write the song for princess Diana's funeral which helped tremendously during that difficult time for the whole country. I began following his career and life ever since that period as I thought he was really courageous and brave to put himself in such delicate situation.
