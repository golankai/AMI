Hasan Daniel is a 31 year old male who was born and currently resides in Canada. He is currently in a relationship and married to his childhood sweetheart of which together they have 3 children. A set of twins, which are both girls and who are aged 5 and another child who is only 6 months old and is a little boy. 
Hasan was extremely excited to have a little boy as he is just like him. Between looking after the children, Hasan also has a job full time working as a consulting civil engineer in the centre of Toronto close to where he lives. He extremely loves his job as he finds it very interesting and wouldn't want to be doing anything else. It also means that his wife doesn't have to work which he is more than happy about. Although Hasan and his family live in Toronto they would love to move to Ottawa as it is somewhere which they have always loved to visit.
