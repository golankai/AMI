Ferd Homenick is a Belgian Art Dealer who started his career back in the early ninety's after attending the prestigious fine art school in Belgium, Ecole Superieure des Arts Saint-~Luc Tournai.   He loved to paint European landscapes and travelled extensively to fulfill his career and passion for painting.  Unfortunately after only 10 years into his career he had a nasty accident on a gondola while visiting Italy for one of his painting trips.  Tragically a gondolier hit Ferds' hand with his oar which severed a tendon and as it was his hand with which he painted he was no long able to continue.  Once recovered rather than wallow in his misfortune he decided to collaborate with one of his close friends and colleagues who owned an art gallery.  He has since gone on to forge a very successful career as a highly regarded fine art dealer.
