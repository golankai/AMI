The late Kenneth Lee Kramm - known as Kenny - founded FLAVORx in order to improve the flavour profile of medications which are often difficult or unpleasant to take as a result of their natural chemical composition. Growing up in Maryland, Kenny graduated with a degree in advertising design from the University of Maryland. The business interest began following the experience of his daughter's epilepsy, leading her to take regular medication. This experience, combined with a career switch which led to Kenny joining the pharmacy firm owned by his father in 1992, presented the opportunity for Kenny's FLAVORx work.
