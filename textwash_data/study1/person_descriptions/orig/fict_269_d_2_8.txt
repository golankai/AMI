Hermann Pacocha Jr was born in 1976 and currently resides in Spain. Hermann is currently in a relationship and works as a marketing executive. 
The information that follows is presumptive and unconfirmed. Hermann has the same name as they father, which has influenced Hermann's perspective - as they felt that they are bound to the legacy the name carries. Two extreme options were available to Hermann: to rebel against such pressure and chose their own path or to conform. They choice of profession seem to indicate the latter choice, but there is no certainty as there is no information about hobbies or any activities outside of work. Together with the age and the marital status, as well as the stereotypes concerning Spanish residents would indicate a relatively conservative approach to life; however if the relationship status is reflective of a long-term arrangement (as opposed to a transitory current status) they may be a pressure to formalise the relationship. 
Overall, it is difficult to provide additional description based on so few facts: the rest would be speculation (even concerning the gender, as it is not specified). The broad picture does lead to a stereotype, but this may be completely false. It is possible to imagine Hermann as a rebellious transgender person, in a happy relationship with open arrangement and an artistic hobby. It is equally possible to imagine Hermann as a white collar criminal pretending to fit the above parameters. It is also possible that Hermann is a man about to marry the love of his life, for whom he was waiting for 20 years.
