 He is part Jewish and is 31 years old.  He has appeared on  some talk shows and appears very friendly with a wicked sense of humour.  He is very versatile and has managed to get some good acting roles and not be typecast from his Harry Potter days.  He is an only child but this hasnâ€™t made him spoilt as he comes across and very caring and not self centred.
