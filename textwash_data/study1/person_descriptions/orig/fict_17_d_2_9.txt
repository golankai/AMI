Ferd is a gentleman that comes from Belgium. Ferd was Born and raised in Belgium. He is 53 years old and is still a bachelor. Ferd is a dealer. It is unclear what type of dealer he is. Fred could be a drug dealer. Although this seems unlikely as they usually have women falling all over them. 

Ferd could be a card dealer in a casino. This would make sense being single perhaps he has spent too many hours on night shift to have a relationship. The last one I can think of is a car dealer. This could also make sense as they spend many hours including on weekends working. 

Ferds last name is homesick. It doesn't sound like a Belgium name. Perhaps Ferds parents were born elsewhere.
