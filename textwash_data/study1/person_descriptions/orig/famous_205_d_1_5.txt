Mick Jagger, famous gnarly resilient lead singer of the world-famous, enduring rock and roll band, The Rolling Stones, still looks like a man in the prime of his career. By default, he and the band are a British institution and have produced acclaimed albums and have staged amazing world tours in each decade since 1960s. His slim frame and lined face appear not to have changed that much since his 20s. He is now in his 70s and still performing with the Stones with the vigour and commitment of a younger man, despite his recent heart issue on a tour in 2019.. He has an extended family, having married several times and has children to Marsha Hunt, Bianca Jagger and Jerry Hall, amongst others. He is currently dating 32 year old Melanie Hamrick. He writes many of his songs with fellow band member, Keith Richards. Some of his songs are gentle and romantic, not least ‘Wild Horses’ and these emotions are conveyed despite the gravel timbre of his voice. He once said he has to keep on touring and making money in order to finance his large family. He is generally highly respected as an ageing rocker.
