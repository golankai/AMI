Dr Brantley Ratke comes from Uganda, a landlocked country in eastern africa, very close to kenya. He works in a museum which he takes pride in as it is a museum all about africas history and culture which he gets to see people enjoy every day. Though he is an offficer, there are very little areas of concern for Brantley to concern himself with as he roams the grounds of the museum. There has never been any thefts of breachers whilst he has worked there as it is an atmosphere of learning and pride in their culture. Brantley was a married man, but he separated amicabley with his wife in the late 2000s, they were young and maybe married too early, but are still on good terms.
