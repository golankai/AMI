Hansan Daniel is a Consulting civil engineer, who achieved his dream profession after studying relentlessly at the University of Alberta, at which time met with his current girlfriend and love interest, Sarah. A late starter at University, Hasan was a quiet individual who was both money and career driven, his introverted nature meant he always put money and time before friends; putting his goals foremost

Hasan still works to this philosophy, spending very little time at home, with projects keeping him up until the early morning. In the little free time he does get, Hasan considers himself a family man, looking after his two children Jacob and Reese. Using his built wealth, Hasan indulges himself in fancy cars and watches, indulging himself in a first class lifestyle, that he can barely sustain.
