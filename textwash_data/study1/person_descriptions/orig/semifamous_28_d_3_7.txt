Charles' most noteable work was his involvement in the Brown v Board of Education Case in 1954 in which the Supreme Court made the landmark decision that US state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. 
Charles taught at both Colombia and Yale Law Schools during his ilustrious career, he even taught Hilary Clinton during his time at Yale. Black also wrote a number of books during his career, most notably ""Impeachment: A Handbook"" which was found to be most useful particularly during the Watergate scandal. As well as his academic works Black also wrote poetry, publishing three volumes during his lifetime.
