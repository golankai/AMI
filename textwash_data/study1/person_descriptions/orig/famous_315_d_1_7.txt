Harry potter actor from a very young age, most of his career will always be traced back to his role in the JK Rowling stories. He has tried to branch out in various other movies as well as theatre pieces I believe. He is known for his lightning bolt scar in the movies as well as round spectacles. He likes to keep a low radar with the paparazi. He was born in England and he is 31 years old. He is quite short and has mousey to dark brown hair. He has spoken quite candidly about his mental health issues due to the popularity of the harry potter series and even admits his alcohol issues after his rise to fame personally and his inability to be seen away from the franchise. That said, he seems to be living a happier life now and is pursuring passions which he enjoys now and does enjoy messing with the media from time to time!
