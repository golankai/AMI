Hugh Grant is a British actor. His full name is Hugh John Mungo Grant. Mr Grant is also a film producer. He was born in 1960 in London. He is a talented actor with many film credits to his name. Mr Grant can do comedy acting and has in recent years also received acclaim for his serious acting roles such as A very English Scandal and Florence Foster Jenkins. I really enjoyed his film Bridget Jones Diary and About a Boy. In his private life Hugh Grant is now married and he and his wife have several children. Mr Grant turned sixty this year, in his professional career Mr Grant is yet to win an Oscar or a bafta award for his acting roles although many think this is long overdue. Previous to getting married Hugh Grant had quite a colourful private life, he was arrested in Hollywood for a sexual misdemeanour. In more recent times Mr Grant has done a lot of good work in regards to the phone hacking scandal that involved the British newspapers for which he has been applauded
