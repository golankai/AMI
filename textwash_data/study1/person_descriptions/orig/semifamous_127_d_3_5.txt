Kenny Kramm was a pioneering man in the field of  medicine and most notably flavouring medicines. 

He was born in Washington DC but graduated from the university of Maryland with a degree in advertising design. 

When his daughter became ill and started having epileptic seizures she had to get medicine, but the foul tasting nature of these medicines meant that his daughter refused to swallow or spat it out, meaning that she continued to have seizures. 

So this is when Kenny had the genius idea of flavouring medicines and he founded FlavourX. 

Unfortunately Kenny died from sepsis in 2016 from an infection.
