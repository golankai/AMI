Elton john into my knowledge he is an english singer and pianist. Last time i saw him on TV was in an advertisement for snickers. He is a loud person when i see him in interviews and not my favourite singer to be honest. But as i can recall that i used to listen to 2 of his song so much until now which are rocket man and tiny dancer.  All i can know about him is that he is an old person and a bit naive. Also he is gay and a good composer. 
Altjough he might not be my type of a singer i know from interview with some celebrities that had contact with him that he is a friendly, supportive and opportunistic person. So to sum up he is a good personality with a lovely heart man.
