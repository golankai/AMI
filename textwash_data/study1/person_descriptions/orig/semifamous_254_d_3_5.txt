It was in this field that Kramm would make his name.  The founding of Flavourx was widely believed to have come about from Kramm's daughter being unwilling to take her medication for epilepsy due to the abhorent taste.  Kramm came up with the idea of creating a sweetenr for medicines which would make them more appealing.  The outcome turned into a success as Flavourx became a standard ingredient in childs medicines.
