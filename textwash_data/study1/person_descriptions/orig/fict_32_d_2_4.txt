Dr Brantley Ratke is a Museum Education Offiver currently working and living in Uganda but grew up and spent most of his life in the United kingdom. He moved to Uganda 5 Years ago after his divorce made him reassess his work and what he wants from life. He quit his job in London, packed up and moved to Uganda to take up his dream job after giving up on that dream when he got married and his wife wanted him to get a 'good' job. He's now 37 and still single after having no time for dating as his job keeps him too busy. His two boys, Bill and Ben, from his marriage come to visit him every summer and he always makes sure to fly back to London for Special occasions (birthdays, holiday etc)
