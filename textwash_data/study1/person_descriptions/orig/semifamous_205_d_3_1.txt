6th Governor of Maine, Enoch Lincoln was a formidable lawyer of his day. He lived for a mere 40 years during the 19th century in the United States, but during this short time established himself as a prominent and active political representative. He graduated from Harvard College in 1807 and soon embarked upon a relentless political career, He had little time for a life outside of this, and had no known wife or children. His most notable role was as serving US congress until his resignation in 1826. He then went on to become Governor of Maine from 1827 until his death in 1829. Such was his popularity that the town of Lincoln in Maine was named after him in his honour.
