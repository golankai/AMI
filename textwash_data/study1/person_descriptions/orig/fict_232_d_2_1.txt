Dr Brantley Ratke is 37 and resides in Sweden.
His job as a museum education officer is important to him as it enables him to show the public the wonderful exhibits in the museum that he loves so much.
His job allows him to interact with all ages of the public and he particularly likes showing young people how important the artifacts are as part of history and also their relevance to the present.
He is in charge of displays and information and one of the most fun parts of his job is to decide the best place to display the items, so that the public will get the most from the visit.
He is so busy with his most enjoyable job that he doesnt have time for a relationship and so he is single at present. However he is a member of a dating website and is currently in communication with a lovely person who also happens to be interested in museums. He hopes to show this person his museum one day.
