Elton John is a 73-year-old British musician who sang, composed and played the piano. He composed the music for Billy Elliot and often performed wearing some crazy looks!
When he first found his love for music, he dropped out of school - at the age of 17 - to follow his dream. He played with a group and then put together his stage name from 2 members of the group! 
Elton John has sold over 300 million records which makes him one of the best-selling music artists.
He was born on the twenty-fifth of March, nineteen forty-seven (hence his age, 73).
