This person is a footballler and keen to be a star. He came from a poor family which he sees himself growing fast. He wants to be like Christiano Ronaldo or Messi. He wants to gain a lot of money ans seek to enter the league clubs to earn more and be famous. He might be generous which can dedicate some of his money back to his country to stop children suffer from poverty and hunger. He is keen to maintain his reputation to prevent from being attacked later and charge with fines. He wants the beat for his family and especially his mom that raised him with her tears. He is currently working very hard to be able to achive his best. I rhink he has good personality. He might has love to football and not to study. So he prefer a career in a hobby rather than in a scientific field.
