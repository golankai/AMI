Enoch Lincoln was born in 1788 and raised in Massachusetts. He studied law at Harvard College and graduated in 1807. He practised law in Salem from 1811 and served as a US district attorney between 1815 and 1818. He was elected to represent the Maine district and become a member of the US House of Representatives, where he was in office for 8 years.

Although he lived a short life (in comparison to life expectancy now) of 40 years, he seemed to have lived a prestigious one, where he was respected by many. During those times, it would have been difficult to get a position of power without connections and he was still voted in, each time with over 90% of the votes. As a respected republican, he must have had similar values and beliefs to his voters and followed their way of thinking.
