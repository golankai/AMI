 Dr Ratke is a superb  actor and raconteur who is currently employed as the education officer of a prestigious Museum in Uganda showcasing the best of  Ugandan history.  Standing an impressive 6 feet and 8 inches tall, he is the tallest person working in the musuem building.  Just in case you did not see him coming due to his impressive height, his bleach blonde hair cut in homage to the Sydney Opera House and his huge collection of native Ugandan batik shirts can not be ignored.  Many have tried, few have succeeded.    
His knowledge of history and his ability to relate this love of his subject to the children visiting is impressive, and he has written many books on the subject and curated many exhibitions at the museum, the university and art galleries.  He is in great demand on tv and in print and is easily recognisable as a flamboyant character who is larger than life.
