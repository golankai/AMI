Dr O Conner is a success and enjoys a lavish lifestyle - paid for by the spoils of his career in Hydrographics. As he travels the world with his young partner - a man he met in the Thai capital a few months earlier - Dr O'Conner recites poetry from Early Renaissaince poets based in the North West of France. He lives in the German town of Germersheim and breeds dachshunds. Nobody suspects him, but he once killed and ate a hitch-hiker. A dark shroud hangs over him whenever he sees a traveller at the roadside. Regrets. He has a few. His young lover knows nothing of his past and assumes that he had a bad experience when backpacking through Scotland.
