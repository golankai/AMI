Ferd is a dealer in leaves.  Although hailing from Belgium he spends most of his life in Japan and Canada where he collects the rare leaves most-prized by his wealthy patrons.  Ferd has an alsation pup named Horowitz.  Horowitz, being a puppy, loves playing in piles of leaves.  Ferd often spends hours collecting rare leaves, sorting them into large piles by colour and size, only to have them destroyed by a playful bound from Horowitz.  Ferd's felt fedora is a permanent fixture atop his head, hiding the fact that he has two long strands of purple hair sticking out from the top of his head.  His head is a curious dome shape and some sources say his mother's dog licked his head into that shape when he was a baby.
