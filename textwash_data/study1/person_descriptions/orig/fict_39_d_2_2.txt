What is a hydrographic surveyor? His name is Doctor Dwaine O'conner. It is soooooooo hard to describe someone who is nonexistent. If I don't know anything, how can I describe Doctor Dwaine O'conner?                                                                                                
   
     Is Doctor Dwaine O'conner in a relationship with a man or a woman or something different like a dog? I think I met a man with the same or different name on a maybe nonexistent planet in a parallel universe. In my view, I think that he has some family members and a singular friend and a relation with a cardboard box.
