Hasan Daniel is a long scar next to his right eye and often wears only black because at the weekends he impersonate Christian bale. Sometimes people Christian bale but he's not Welsh he is Canadian. It does come with some benefits though he sometimes gets free meals and upgrades on flights. Last year he even got tickets with a plus one (because he's in a relationship) the Premier of batman (they thought he was Christian bale. He has brown hair and dark eyes, a thin nose which is quite long. From time to time he argues with his wife because she doesn't like him wearing capes and saying ""I'm batman"". Christian bale needs help designing so hasan is working as his civil engineer for free to learn his mannerisms.
