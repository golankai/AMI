Yassine El Ghanassy is a fine footballer who, recently turning 30 years old has started to look so as well. Ghanassy who is of middle eastern descent has a young demeanour and attitude in his relationships. He usually wears a hoodie, some jeans and comfortable trainers when he is not playing football. He is talkative and doesn't give the time of day to people who are not socially the same or display a level enthusiasm about them.
As a footballer he has allowed the fame and glory to get to his head a little. Living each day as it comes with little plans towards the future if football doesn't one day work out.
