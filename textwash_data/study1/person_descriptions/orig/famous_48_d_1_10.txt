I am not sure which Sam Smith you mean I know two sort of famous Sam Smith's, one is a singer who I know nothing about apart from I think they won one of the talent shows on television, I would not recognize them if they passed me in the street! I believe they are still quite popular and turn up every now and then on television to promote a new album or an upcoming tour. They may now be producing and composing music rather than performing live. 

The other one is a average British tennis player, they did not reach any major finals in their career and I don't think they are still playing but this is just a guess I don't know for sure.
