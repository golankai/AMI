Dr. Brantley Ratke is a Ugandan Museum education officer, who became famous in 2021 for a viral advertising campaign that sought to raise awareness of Ugandan and African history. Ratke was born in 1983 in the city of Kira at the height of the Ugandan Bush War. He was born to Namazzi Natukunda Ratke, a prominent female propagandist for the National Resistance Army who covertly worked for General Tito Okello as a spy, and with whom she secretly had Brantley. His childhood was tumultuous, spending most of the time with his mother but visiting his father at the presidential palace for every other weekend. His mother was a strict disciplinarian and instilled a tough work ethic in Brantley. It was through his fun-loving father Tito that he found his love for Uganda and a pride in his cultural heritage. He attended a British private school in Kampala between ages 11-18 and studied Sub-saharan anthropology at Oxford University for both undergraduate and postgraduate study, before returning to Uganda to open the National Tito Okello Memorial Museum of Uganda in 2005. By allowing access to many resources and exhibitions online alongside recorded lectures from world-renowned historians, Ratke ensured the National Tito Okello Memorial Museum of Uganda became a world leader in African history. His viral ad campaign in 2021, famous for it's hilarious use of Safari animals with party hats, quickly became an internet sensation and raised the profile of the National Tito Okello Memorial Museum of Uganda, and Ratke himself, to worldwide fame. He lives in Kampala with his best friend, a Lion he has called Tito. He is not married, but has many unconfirmed children.
