Dr. Brantley Ratke was born in Sweden in 1987. As he grew up he became fascinated with historical events and often asked his grandparents to talk to him about by-gone days. This fascination led him to study History at Lund University. He continued his studies to doctoral level. His specialist areas include the history of WW1 and  Egyptology. Dr. Ratkeâ€™s interests led him to a post working as a Museum Education Officer at The Swedish History Museum, where he is able to share his expert knowledge and experience with the students. He is currently single, although would be interested in meeting someone with the same passion for History.
