Amelie works long hours as an IT trainer, which can also involve a lot of travel to different training venues throughout Austria, however, most of the training has been taking place virtually this year due to a worldwide pandemic.  She works hard and so during her free time, Amelie enjoys playing sports (including skiing) and going to the gym, meeting up with her family and friends.  Amelie enjoys cooking for friends and socialising at home, and travelling/holidays.  She has a quick wit and enjoys banter with her work colleagues within IT.  Amelie has a heart of gold and volunteers within her local community.  She is outgoing, funny, sociable but with a serious and reserved side - she equally enjoys her own company as much as she enjoys being around others.  Amelie has worked in IT for many years and wonders if she should have a complete career change.
