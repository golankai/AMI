Irvin Brooks was an American baseball player, born in 1891 in Key West, Florida. During his career, he was known as Irvin - and occasionally incorrectly as Irving. 

Irvin played in the so-called 'Negro Leagues', which comprised teams of African Americans, and occasionally Latin Americans. 

He was known for his incredibly energetic style of play, and was an idol for young African American boys at the time. He regularly spent time with his young fans after games, hoping to inspire them to pursue their dreams, despite the restrictions that were in place at the time, envisioning a future where African Americans would play in the regular league.
