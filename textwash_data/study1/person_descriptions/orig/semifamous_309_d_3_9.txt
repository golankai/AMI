Walter K Chorn was born Jan 21 1885 in Howard County Missouri. This guy went to Vanderbitt college in 1906 he was in Kappa Sigma, where he played college football and his position was guard, I don't know a lot about  college football but I think that must be o defence position maybe. So I think Walter must have been very fit and worked hard in the games he played for the college. I reckon he had a very good sense of  loyalty to his team and fellow players. He appears to have collected a few awards whilst at college SIAA championship 1906, All Southern 1905 and 1912 All time Candy second team. So all not bad really i can just imagine the parties and drinking after a win bet they were 'fun'  After college he opened o law office in Fayette Missouri were after practising for two years went on to become in 1913 Chief Clark of the supreme court of Missouri. He lived i think a very colourful life and to the full and never left his Missouri that was were his.heart was he died  Feb 26 1933 in Kansas City Missouri age 48, which really is these days no age and to be honest his life was only really stsrting .
