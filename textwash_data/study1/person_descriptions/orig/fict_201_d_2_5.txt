Although Lucia has gained a high level qualification during her life, she can be very stupid at times! In her career, she made many silly mistakes and quite a few enemies. However, she is brave and courageous and for this she has many loyal workers in her team.
Outside of work, Lucia continues to live a full life, at weekends she goes skydiving regularly, enjoying the thrill of jumping out of aeroplanes at 60000 feet up.   She has also tried scuba diving, wing walking and rough water kayaking.
At 63 she is still very fit and healthy, although she is a bit overweight as she enjoys eating.  She absolutely loves anything with salted caramel!
