Adele is a thirty-two year old, British singer song-writer and pop culture icon known for hit singles such as Hello, Someone Like You & Rolling in the Deep. She has released 3 albums, all named after the age she was when she recorded them. These have sold millions of copies worldwide and earned her a total of 15 Grammies, as well as one Oscar. Her voice type can be classified as that of a mezzo-soprano’s and her style is largely influenced by the soul and folk genre, but hints of Southern blues can also be found. Her personal life shouldn’t be anyone’s business but people seem really fixated on her weight.
