from what i know mick jagger is a rock and roll musician/ an old white guy who is definitely very wealthy. i think he is still alive but i'm not completely sure and like most legends of his kind he is british.  he is a legend in his industry and super talented, gaining fame from the band that he was in (a quick google search confirmed this to be the rolling stones).  since i don't have anymore to say than this the rest of the paragraph will be facts from the internet: he is alive and wasn't just in the rolling stones but in fact their lead singer. they seem to somehow still be a band and they might be releasing an album soon.
