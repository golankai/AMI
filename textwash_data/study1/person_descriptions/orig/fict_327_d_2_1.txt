Brantley Ratke is better known as ""Bran"" to his friends and social media followers alike.  This name suits him in more ways than one.  He is a fervent vegan and famously follows a very high fibre diet.  Although unmarried and currently unattached, Bran has had a series of high profile relationships over the past few years- most notably recently with a Swedish supermodel, although this was short lived.  Bran's job as a Museum education officer means that he has been keen to use social media platforms to promote his museum's important educational role, not only in Sweden, but also across Europe and North America.
