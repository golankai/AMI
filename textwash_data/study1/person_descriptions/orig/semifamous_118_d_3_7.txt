He also wrote more than 20 books and hundreds of articles on constitutional law, admiralty law, capital punishment, the role of the judiciary and other legal subjects, including ''Impeachment: A Handbook,'' that was widely praised in 1974, when President Richard M. Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal, and also when reissued during the 1999 proceedings against President Bill Clinton.

The handbook was an analysis of the law and history of impeachment, and took no position on the fates of Nixon or Clinton. As a liberal Democrat, Professor Black had no sympathy for Nixon politically. But in letters to newspapers, he argued against forcing Nixon to surrender tape recordings that implicated him, contending that the balance of federal power might be harmed if the principle of executive privilege was breached. But a judge ruled against Nixon, who resigned in the face of certain impeachment.

Professor Black was a vehement opponent of capital punishment, and his book, ''Capital Punishment: the Inevitability of Caprice and Mistake'' (Norton, 1974), argued against it. The United States Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1972, in part because states were arbitrarily imposing it. Dozens of states had passed new laws to revive the practice, and the book contended that the new statutes were as bad as the old ones.
