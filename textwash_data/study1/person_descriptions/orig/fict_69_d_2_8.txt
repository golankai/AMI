They are aged 9 and 12. Herman is somewhat of a family man and believes in the old traditional Christian style family. He is married to his wife Estella, who works in music production for big acts such as Tiesto, Paul van Dyk and Armin van Buuren. They live in a small coastal town in Spain called Aguero, which has a population of 20,000 people.
