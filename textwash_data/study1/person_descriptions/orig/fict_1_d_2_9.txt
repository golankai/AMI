He is bald with a pot belly and a bad smoking habit. Lives in an apartment on his own. Is he a drug dealer? Car dealer? I'll go with the former. He lives a dangerous life, fancies himself as a bit of a mafioso, but in reality he is just a grubby little pot dealer in Belgium. He thinks he is much grander than he really is. He has been dealing all his life, that is all he knows. He is divorced and has children he never sees - this is his choice, he is a deadbeat dad. He speaks flemish and french and a bit of english so he can also see to tourists. he regularly goes to amsterdam to visit the red light district. he has friends at the local pub and plays darts.
