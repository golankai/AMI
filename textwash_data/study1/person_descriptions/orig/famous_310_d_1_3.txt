She was a Child actress first starred in Harry Potter. She Went on later in adult life to do a Disney flim which I’m sure is every actress goal. Her private life seems to be kept out of social media which is good. She Has the ability to play any role in flims. She seems adaptable. I do not know much more about her as an actress. I’m sure she does charity work of some kind I’m just not sure what sort. She lives in London and is from london. She would do well in Charles Dickson flim the Christmas carol. Or any other old victorion flim setting. I would like to see her star in the new Harry Potter flims that would be good to see what happened them all as adults.
