Aleksandr Gryazin is a russian footballer who is now retired. He is in his late fourties and enjoys keeping fit. 

His height is roughly 1.75metre and his stature slender yet muscular. He has ash-blond hair, which is lightly receding, likes to be clean-shaven and has brownish eyes. When reading he uses glasses. Aleksandr has two tattoos, one on his right calf and the other on his left triceps. 

When resting his face, his lips seems to go down rather than up. He has some light wrinkles around his eyes as he used to squint his eyes when reading before getting glasses. His skin is fairly pale but he does enjoy a sun bed session every now and then, giving him a small amount of frackles.
