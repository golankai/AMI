Enoch Lincoln was a prominent US politician in the early 19th Century. Born in 1788, shortly after American Independence, to a father who was a revolutionary and one of America's first congressmen, his eventual entry into national politics seemed somewhat inevitable.
From his childhood home in Massachusetts, he studied at Harvard College, graduating in 1807. From there he went on to study law, and was admitted to the bar in 1811, where he went on to start his own practice in Salem. He served as a District Attorney here fro 1815-1818.
In 1818, he was elected to congress  as a Democratic-Republican, representing Maine, following the resignation of the congressman running at the time. From there he was re-elected into the next four congresses, representing a number of parties as party definitions were changing, and served in congress up until his resignation in 1826. After that he served as Governor of Maine for three terms until his death in 1829.
