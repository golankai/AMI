Hasan Daniel is actually a really nice guy, I say this because he comes from canada and people that come from there seem to be really nice. especially when you compare them with america.
Regardless, he lives happily with his partner all the way in toronto, that's where most people live. He's 31 years of age and you can tell he came to this point beucase he has a good relationship with someone that loves him, otherwise he would probable also have white hair due to loneliness. He is a Consulting civil engineer, a boring job but nevertheless somewhat rewarding.

He likes building snow men because he lives in canada and that's all he does in the spare time. By now Hasan would have build another snow man. Minewihle his wife is stearing at him from within the house
