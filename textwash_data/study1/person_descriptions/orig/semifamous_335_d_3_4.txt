Clyde's ascent to the heights of Indian football were a combination of sheer skill, perseverance, resilience and complete fortitude on his and his parents' behalf.  His wiry, think whippet-like frame zips him around the pitch, setting up goals for the forwards with alarming accuracy and precision - much to the delight of the home ground of Ozone.  His footwork is astonishing and he seems to have a sixth-sense, knowing where his strikers are going to be before the strikers know themselves; his maturity on the pitch is breathtaking and awe-inspiring. His appearances have been steady, yet his goal-scoring record is still showing nil - which is surprising considering his agility, speed, all-round skills and his accuracy in passing. His club- Ozone - were approached recently by another top-flight Indian team but they steadfastly refused to sign over his contract, believing that Clyde's career will develop more, his goal-scoring will develop over time and his off-pitch social media profile will continue to take-off, bringing in much needed 'followers' of 'influencers' and the like and thus money for sponsorship and much needed stadium and gounds' up-keep.
