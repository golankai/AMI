Michael is a very fit and sporty man. He did very good at school in his teenage years but his heart was always into sports, so he decided from an early age to follow up his instincts and work hard improving his phisical strength.  This didn't pleased his father who wanted a career in the City as a banker for him - following his own career. Nevertheless Micheal never really warmed into the banking environment and unfortunately decided against it, making his relationship with his father a very difficult one from the really beginning of his teenage years. That didn't stop him to work even harder to pursue his dreams to become a cricketer - something he succeeded in doing with great results. Despite this, his father remained very distant and never really appreciate Michael's achievements.
