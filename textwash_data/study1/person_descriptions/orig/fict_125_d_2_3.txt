Hasan is a hard-working, driven, Canadian-based, young professional who works in the field of civil engineering. He has specialised in consulting services within the exciting industry of civil engineering.
At the age of 31, he has already achieved more than he could've ever possibly imagined and he still managed to make time for a serious relationship.
This proves Hasan's commitment not just on the workplace but in his personal life as well.
He is clearly a reliable, trustworthy human being who is making an invaluable contribution to the wider society. 
Hasan's family are probably proud of him for his achievements and I would not be surprised if he had a successful social life and plenty of friends who care about him
