Christian Bale full name Christian Charles Philip Bale is a famous actor born in the UK, His mum was a circus performer and his dad was a Pilot.
He is probably best known for playing Batman, he also played John Conor in Terminator Genesis, in my opinion an underrated performance.
For me his best roll was in the film of the 2008 jarket crash the Big Short he plays michael burry a pretty strange unsocial guy who finds a huge gap in tye market shorting the mortfage market and the funds that they were built into.
He has a unique voice and recently voiced Bagheera in the Mogli film legend of the Jungle
He is a great actor with huge appeal.
