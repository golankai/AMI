Dr Brantley Ratke, a single man, aged 37 last birthday, is the education officer at an important museum in Sweden. He's tall, around 6.1, slight but physically fit, with blond hair and very blue eyes. He is intelligent, having graduated in Education at the University of Stockholm; interested in teaching others and seeing both adults and children grow in knowledge. So he's self-giving, relaxed, able to hold people's attention with illustrations and pointed questions, and practical demonstrations. His interests are limited mostly to his work and the local football team. He spends free time with friends, laughing, drinking beer and putting the world to rights. He wants to marry, but has been too tied to his job to give this attention. Perhaps, next year!
