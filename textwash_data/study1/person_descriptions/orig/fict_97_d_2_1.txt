I guess this person has a strong knowledge in museum stuff. He is a very educated person. Dedicate his time to research and innovation. He  is a smart guy and willing to sacrifice his life to science. He doesn't have a social life as he is single at the age of 37. I can see him as a calm person ""because he lives in sweden"" . He has a comfort life at night in which he doesn't go to pubs and nightclubs. He might have some friends from work but no where else. Such a person i consider him a reasonable and intelligent. He doesn't lie. He doesn't love to have responsibilities outside of his careers.
