Clyde Cyril Fernandes is a 26 year old Indian professional footballer. He currently plays for Ozone FC.
He was born in Mumbai, and always showed an affinity towards playing football. His father would try and discourage this by taking him to watch cricket whenever he had finished working in the market - but Fernandes was never interested and always dreamed of captaining the Indian international team in the World Cup.
He would hide his football under his bed, and smuggle it to school with him. Teachers would complain at his disruptive and distracted behaviour, always talking about football or kicking around the corridors.
Fernandes made his international debut for the Indian U16 side in South Africa.
