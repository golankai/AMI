Dr Dwaine O'Conner is a man in his early 60s. At some point he graduated with a PhD and he now works as a hydrographic surveyor, a job where one is required to use complicated technology to map underwater surfaces. Due to the complexity of this job as well as his advanced educational background it can certainly be said that Dr Dwaine O'Conner is an intelligent man. Because he possesses an English name it can be assumed that O'Conner is not a native German citizen. At some point he emigrated to Germany where he now lives with his partner. O'Conner is probably bilingual due to this. The gender of his partner or O'Conner's sexual orientation is unknown.
