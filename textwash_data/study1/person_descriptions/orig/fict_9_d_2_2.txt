Dwaine is a German hydrographic surveyor who is 62 and almost retired. Even though Dwaine loves his job, he knows he must retire soon to spend more time with his family in Hamburg. Dwaine's love for the sea came about from his Grandfather taking him on fishing trips outside Hamburg. Dwaine then spent his summers growing up going to the lake to sail. He then went on to study marine biology at university and so has a deep love for the sea and its inhabitants. Dwaine has been married for 35 years to his childhood sweetheart Greta who would accompany him to the lakes in summer. Dwaine and Greta have 4 children and 14 grandchildren who Dwaine is excited to spend more time with after his retirement.
