Kenny is a relatively small, pale man with black hair and a black moustache. He wears prescription glasses and often dresses formally to fit his entrepreneurial lifestyle except when in the lab where lab gear is worn. He has a large forehead and pronounced cheek bones with a small chin and mouth. His nose is somewhat wide and he has well cared-for white teeth. He is not particularly hairy and is well-kept in general, with big ears that stick out slightly. There are some wrinkles and imperfections on his skin that have come from ageing and protective gear from the lab. His arms are not too heavily used in his line of work and so they do not have too much excess muscle.
