Hasan experienced tragedy at the early age of 10 with the death of his father in a road traffic accident. The family had been travelling together in a car in a rural part of Winnipeg in bad weather conditions when the car skidded on a uneven road surface and crashed in to a tree. His father, who had been driving the car, was killed instantly. His mother and brother were seriously injured in the accident but Hasan was remarkably unharmed. Both his mother and brother made a full recovery.
