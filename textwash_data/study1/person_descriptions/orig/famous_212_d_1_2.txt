Ed Sheeran is a singer and songwriter that has done well within his profession. I personally don't like the type of music he writes but appreciate that in his genre he's well thought off, He's got ginger hair and I believe wears glasses and mainly plays the guitar. He wanted to be in, Game of Thrones as a soldier and I think he was killed in that, He also has appeared in a film called Yesterday which was good. He seems a friendly person and has had several hit singles as well as albums. Don't know more about him as he's not my genre of music. Not heard much of his music and not to bothered about it. To me, he isn't that good but wish I could have his money
