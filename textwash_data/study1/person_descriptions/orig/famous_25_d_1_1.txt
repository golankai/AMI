British actor of stage and screen who became widely (and wildly) famous through his role as Sherlock Holmes in the recent BBC TV adaptation. His overcoat/greatcoat became almost as famous and has since been a best seller for the clothes maker Belstaff. That gorgeous overcoat retailed at around Â£1000 putting it out of reach for my husband alas.
The equally gorgeous Benedict Cumberbatch has a strong female fan base based on his very English, slightly awkward looks with glass cutting cheekbones. There was much mouring when he married the woman he loved.

Since Sherlock he has had an increasingly successful career both on stage with roles in Frankenstein; Rosencrantz & Gildernstern are Dead and Hamlet in Rehersal. On screen his roles in film include Dr Strange (utterly bonkers, psychedelic superhero film along side Tilda Swinton); star Trek: Into Darkness; The Fifth Estate; and Twelve Years a Slave.
On television Parade's End; Patricl Melrose and a Sesame Street appearance spring to mind!
