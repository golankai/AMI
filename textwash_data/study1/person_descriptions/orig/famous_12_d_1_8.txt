Christian Bale is a very talented british actor who plays alot of american roles and therefore has a very realistic american accent.
He is a white man with brown hair, rather thin and tall. He has a very chiselled face with promenent facial features.
His famous roles include playing batman, american psycho and in the prestige. 
I think that he won awards for those roles however i am not too sure, even if he didnt, he definitely deserved to.
He is very famous, although i can only think of those 3 films that he has been in. 
His career is very sucessful and he is very well known as a result of this.
