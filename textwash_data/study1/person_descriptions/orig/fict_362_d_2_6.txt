Rinda Schuster is a 69 old retired sales executive. She moved to England from Sweden when she was 21 to be with the man she fell in love with when he visited Geneva on a work trip. They subsequently married, as a high powered career woman she decided to keep her own last name. They went on to have two children: Claudia & Sven. They live a very luxurious lifestyle and never want for anything. They are both recently retired and are looking forwards to travelling and taking up new hobbies together. They are hoping Grandchildren will be on the cards in the not too distant future. Rinda has secretly always hoped of returning to Geneva to live out her later years in her home country.
