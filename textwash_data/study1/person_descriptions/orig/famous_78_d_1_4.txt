A famous musician and songwriter born 1945. Elton is from the UK and  rose to fame in the late 60s early 70s. is known for wearing big extravagant sun glasses. 

He has a very flamboyant style of dressing and his signature item  to wear is big colourful sun-glasses. 

 While I do not know is exact height, he appears to be small to me. These days, he has gotten a little bit bigger around his mid rift, but being his age and having recently recovered from cancer, I think this is something to be celebrated. 

Elton plays the piano whilst performing his songs and is known for being very outspoken. He is a fantastic and energetic performer. One of his most popular songs is Candle in the wind, originally composed for Marilyn Monroe, he re-wrote the lyrics for Lady Diana after her tragic death. 

Elton used to have brown hair but has gotten lighter with the years.
