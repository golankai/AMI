William was an entrepreneur coming from Germany, opting upon arrival to change his name and fully embrace his new life. He started as a teacher before starting a long line of jobs that would eventually lead him to the farming industry. It was there that he invented the power lift sulky plow. This was a tool that allowed farmers to stay seated on their plows without having to drop the plow themselves. From here he seemed to jump around eventually going into business with his brother to invent and patent more creations. By his death he held a total of 94 patents. Also a family man he had two spouses in his lifetime. By his death his company was rapidly expanding, though he never got to see the final success that his hand had created.
