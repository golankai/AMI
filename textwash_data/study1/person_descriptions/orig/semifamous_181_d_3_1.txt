Enoch Lincoln was an early 19th century American lawyer and politician, serving as the governor of Maine from 1827 until his death in October 1829 at the age of 41. Lincoln was the 6th governor of Maine, following Albion Parris. The town of Lincoln, Maine is named after him.

Born in 1788 in Worcester, Massachusetts, Enoch Lincoln was a distant relative of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States of America. He served in the Democratic Republican party, before later joining the Anti-Jacksonian 'National Republican' party later. 

Lincoln graduated from Harvard College in 1807 at the age of 19, beginning his legal studies, presumably, at a precocious age of 16. In Portraits Lincoln has a gentle, reserved demeanour and calm countenance.
