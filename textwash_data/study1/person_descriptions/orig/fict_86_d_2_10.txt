Well what can I say about Amelie Crooks, she appears to be a normal everyday person, going to work as a filling clerk in a large office building for a global company, doing her shopping, watching the television, reading books, doing the garden,  walking the dog and meeting up with friends but unbeknown to anyone that knows her she is really an international bull fighting champion, she travells the world on her annual leave to fight every bull on the list and she is extremely agile and very much a winner, she keeps this a secret as she feels people would see her differently if they knew what her passion really is.
