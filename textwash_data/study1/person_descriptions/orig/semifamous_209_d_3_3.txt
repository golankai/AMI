Yassine El Ghanassy was born on 12th July 1990. He started playing football when he was 15. He was signed by the youth team of La Louvière, where he quickly gained the attention of many sides. At the age of sixteen, he went to the English team Birmingham City, impressing on trial, but a transfer didn't follow as La Louvière wanted a transfer price which was too high for such a young player. in 2008 Yassine made his debut in his first-team La Louviere. Although he was initially added to the youth team, he played a number of games in the Jupiler Pro League. His first goal was scored in the Belgian League playoffs in 2009/10 against Zulte Waregem. Since that goal he has become more prolific.
