On June 5th 1891 in Key West Florida a child was born, his parents name him Irvin Woodberry Brooks.  Irvin grew into a lively little boy whose greatest pleasure was to play baseball with his father. 

At school he played on the team and always loved his game. 
Irvin as an adult played in the Negro leagues as America still had segregation. 
Irvin played with a passion and was part of the team Brooklyn Royal Giants and was an outstanding hitter. He was to become known as one of the all time greats.

As little was really known and recorded back then, reference books have called him Chester Brooks and claim he was born in the Bahamas, this is untrue and reflects society at that time.  
Irvin played for 1918- 1933 and stayed with the same team.
