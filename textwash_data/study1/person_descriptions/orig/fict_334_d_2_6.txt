Rinda Schuster has always been an environmentalist and a disruptive force that manages to bring change from the inside of the system. In her position as a sale executive for a company specialised in electric vehicles, she has fought for the advantages of EVs to be better known and recognised, influencing both the final consumers and local administrations. She has been in a relationship with her partner Joanna for almost 20 years, after her marriage to Peter Smith dissolved in the mid-90. Schuster had 2 children form the marriage, Mary and Helena Schuster-Smith, both well-known conservationist. When she is not in her office looking over last trimester's figures, or at a trade show demonstrating how reliable and exicinti modern EVs are, Rinda enjoys spending her time in her cottage down in Cornwall, gardening, hiking and playing tennis. A keen athlete, she has partecipated in many cross country runs, but the lockdown restrictions have prevented her to compete this year. She has plans to retire in the next few years, and use the connections she has made as a top level exec to keep pushing the agenda of environmentalism and make the word better for generations to come.
