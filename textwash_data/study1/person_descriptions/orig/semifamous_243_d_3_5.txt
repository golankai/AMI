Kenny Kramm was an American entrepreneur who died in 2016, aged 55, of sepsis. He left behind a wife and two children. 

His daughter Shelley was the inspiration for his company FLAVORx: a system of adding palatable flavourings to medicines to increase likelihood of compliance in taking the otherwise foul tasting medicine. When Shelley was a child she refused her eplipcy medicine due to the taste, Kramm altered the taste by adding different flavouring to her medicine and from there FLAVORx was born. 

Prior to starting FLAVORx Kramm had graduated from the University of Maryland and had worked for a time at an advertising agency before switching careers and joining his father pharmacy firm.
