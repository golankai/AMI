im making so many assumptions about this guys, he's boring as hell lmao, he's a marketing executive in spain and doesn't earn that much money, he can't get a wife and the relationship he is in currently is the longest one he has ever been in. he wants to settle down and have kids but he thinks its been too long for him to be able to have them. his dad died when he was 12 and his mom is still alive but she lives in the UK so they don't see each other often. hes a simple man who lives a simple life. his fatal flaw is that he get bored of everything very quickly and that is why his relationships have never lasted long.
