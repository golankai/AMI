Charles Black was an individual who had a passion for the English language and he demonstrated that by writing many books, including The People and the Court, Structure and Relationship in Constitutional Law, and Impeachment: A Handbook. It is evident that the professor had strong morals and that he wasn't one to stand around and not take initiative for the causes he believed in. His time in the Army Air Corps suggests he had a particular devotion to and vigorous support for his country. From his role in the historic Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case, as well as for his Impeachment: A Handbook, it is clear his patriotic tendency didn't lead him to blindly allow unjust actions carried out by his government. Instead he educated the American masses through his literature by providing analyses on the the law of impeachment during the Watergate scandal.
