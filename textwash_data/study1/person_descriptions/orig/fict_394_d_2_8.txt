Well, what can I say about the notorious Hermann Pacocha jr.   I cannot praise this man highly enough. Just like his father and his father before him. He is an experienced Marketing Executive.  Coming from a long line of well respected Marketing Executives. HIs credials in his field are, quite frankly, second to none. A very much respected man of his local community.  This forty-four year old it certainly a pillar of his community.   He is very much a family man being in a stable relationship for many years.  Not a native of Spain.  Nevertheless he has made this country his home.  Giving back to a country he made his home.
