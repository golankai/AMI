Enoch should feel highly honoured to have a town named after him.  Lincoln in Maine marks his life and notability.  He came from a small family with just one brother called Levi after his father.
Enoch went into politics having run a family business.  He eventually became Governor of Maine at the age of 39, but sadly served for just two years before an untimely death at the age of 41.
He was successful in attaining a place at Harvard University to study law which led on to him practising for a number of years, resulting in him spending three years acting as district attorney.
Another interesting fact is that he was related to Abraham Lincoln.
