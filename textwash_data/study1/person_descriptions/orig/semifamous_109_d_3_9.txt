Walter Chorn was a college football player, lawyer and insurance superintendent from Missouri.  He died in 1933 at the age of 48 from a double gunshot wound to the head.  He led a confused life and spent most of his early years dreaming of becoming an insurance superintendent, much to the surprise of his college football teammates.  He was never married however, had a string of nefarious relationships with several local celebrity showgirls and amassed a surprisingly collection of fossilised ferret droppings which he left to his brother, Simeon.  He never liked him.  In later life, Walter found solace in the church and would often recite really awful Christian poetry at his local baptist church.  He was soon ostracised and reverted to Islam where he became known as Mohammed Yusuf.  Mohammed then embarked on a grand tour of the US looking at the possibility of earning a fortune through ferret racing.  This never really proved that profitable but, he dedicated most of his income to this passion and, many commentators have speculated that this is why he never married.
