Ferd Homenick is quite tall, 6 foot(ish), broad shoulders, hes 53 years old but doesnt look it. He has quite a youthful athletic face for his age yet his hair is starting to grey a little. He has dark brown hair. He is a car dealer who works for Ford at Ferd's Fords delaership which he runs himself. He is single but is always seen with a woman at his side (make your own judgements here). He lives in Brussles in belgium however he has lived in other regions of belgium and germany throughout his life. He is fluent in 4 languages (english, dutch, german and french). He seems nice but has a dealers attitude when it comes to talking to people.
